For example, the customer wants to buy a printer and you offer them a scanner that is able to fulfill more objectives on top of the printer ones.</h4><p><br></p><h4 data-identifyelement="510" dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);"><strong dir="ltr">C</strong></span><strong data-identifyelement="517" dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);"><strong>ross-selling</strong></span></strong><br data-identifyelement="516">It means offering the customer <strong data-identifyelement="518">more products</strong> (for example accessories) that <strong data-identifyelement="519">can be used in tandem</strong> with the main product.

Several studies have been made on the topic. One of them found out that the probability of selling to a new customer is between 5 to 20 percentage points while the probability to sell to an existing customer is between 60% to 70%. What does it mean? It means that upsell and cross-sell are great in increasing revenues because they deal with customers that have already bought or are interested in one of your products. Exploiting this fact, we can be sure that the probability of increasing AOV or convincing them to make another order strongly increases.<br data-identifyelement="532"><br data-identifyelement="533"><strong data-identifyelement="534"><span data-identifyelement="535" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">The 4 keywords for upselling and cross-selling</span></strong><br data-identifyelement="536"><br data-identifyelement="537"><strong data-identifyelement="538"><span data-identifyelement="539" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">NEEDS</span></strong><br data-identifyelement="540"><br data-identifyelement="541"><span data-identifyelement="542" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It is known that when a customer contacts the company<strong data-identifyelement="543"> the first thing that should be explored </strong>are the needs. Customers call to request advice, relying on the fact that agents, being experts in what they do, will be able to help them in finding the right product to buy. However, needs are not always well defined. For this reason, <strong data-identifyelement="544">identifying the real issues</strong> and <strong data-identifyelement="545">exploiting your knowledge</strong> is fundamental, <strong data-identifyelement="546">guiding the customer</strong> through a route useful in finding out what are the more "ancestral" needs the customer wants to satisfy. </span><br data-identifyelement="547"><br data-identifyelement="548"><strong data-identifyelement="549"><span data-identifyelement="550" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">VALUE</span></strong><br data-identifyelement="551"><br data-identifyelement="552"><span data-identifyelement="553" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second keyword that can be identified characterizing upselling and cross-selling, and probably the most important one, is <strong data-identifyelement="554" dir="ltr">value</strong>. Everything related to these techniques aims at identifying the <strong data-identifyelement="555">best solution</strong> for the customer. But how are we able to find the best solution? After having identified a need there could be many different solutions able to tackle that. Reducing the overall choice for the customer, providing a simple, but effective solution is the key to increasing the actual and also perceived value. </span><br data-identifyelement="556"><br data-identifyelement="557"><span data-identifyelement="558" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong data-identifyelement="559" dir="ltr">What if the need is not that well defined and so it is difficult to find a solution?

Think about all the products Emma offers Every single offer is related to certain needs. For example, pillows can be helpful in improving neck pain. However, seeing one product-related only to certain needs is reductive. We should think of our products as a <strong data-identifyelement="567">system</strong>.

The more products are used by the customer, the more their sleep is going to be improved. Having this view and a complete product's knowledge is fundamental in guiding the customer to ask the right questions. Having a sort of mental, or also written map, that links all the questions that can be used to find upsell and cross-sell opportunities, defining some paths that could be taken to guide the customer.</span><br data-identifyelement="571"><br data-identifyelement="572"><span data-identifyelement="573" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Behind an example of that is displayed:</span><br data-identifyelement="574"><br data-identifyelement="575"><br data-identifyelement="576"><br data-identifyelement="577"><span data-identifyelement="578" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span data-resolvable-asset="true" data-type="spr-social-media-asset-photo" data-assetid="66e01d9e6786193b8ead536b"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/3010077991346/original/u6Y7_UkOM7xUoltxKbCNME0Lo6xN9r70wQ.png?1641900126" style="width: auto;max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="3010077991346" data-identifyelement="579"></span></span></h4><p data-identifyelement="580" dir="ltr"><br data-identifyelement="581"></p><h4 data-identifyelement="582" dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Remember that during a call there is usually only <strong data-identifyelement="583">one opportunity to upsell</strong> since the advice is to go for a more premium product but of the same type, while there could be<strong data-identifyelement="584"> several opportunities to cross-sell</strong> (as seen above).<br data-identifyelement="585"><br data-identifyelement="586"><br data-identifyelement="587"><strong data-identifyelement="588"><span data-identifyelement="589" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">TIMING</span></strong><br><br><span data-identifyelement="589" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Timing is also very important.
