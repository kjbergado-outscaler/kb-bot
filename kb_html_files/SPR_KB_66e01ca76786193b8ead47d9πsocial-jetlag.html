Our <strong>social </strong>or <strong>professional everyday life </strong>can also throw us out of phase. </p><p><br></p><p>How? This question is actually easy to answer: </p><p><br></p><p>Our day has 24 hours - but quite often, our schedule calls for many more </p><p dir="ltr">To do justice to all tasks or events, we start cutting back on time at one particular juncture: our sleep.</p><p dir="ltr"><em> "I don't need that much sleep!" </em>or<em> "I'll catch up on my sleep at the weekend!"</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em dir="ltr"> </em></p><p dir="ltr">While our body actually wants to shut down and<strong> needs sleep to recover</strong>, our <strong>social circumstances do not allow us </strong>to meet this need and we postpone and most likely shorten our sleep time. </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p><br></p><p>Our social clock is entering into competition with our biological clock, so to speak. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">What are the consequences of social jet lag?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span dir="ltr" style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(243, 121, 52);"> </span></strong></p><p>Social jetlag, like travel-related jetlag, can lead to daytime sleepiness, headaches, stomach problems or difficulties falling asleep. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">It is usually more frequent and longer-lasting than our holiday trips by plane, a serious burden of sleep debt can accumulate. </p><p>This has damaging cumulative effects - both short and long-term - that result in wide-ranging and dire consequences on our health, such as: </p><ul><li>a weakened immune system, </li><li>a rise in the risk of many diseases including cancer, hypertension, coronary diseases, stroke, obesity and diabetes </li><li>But also, psychological distress and disorders can be associated with sleep deprivation due to social jet lag, for example: </li><li>Listlessness, </li><li>anxiety, and </li><li dir="ltr">depression </li></ul><p><br></p><p>A note to all “weekend dormice” among us:<u> sleep debt cannot simply be made up with a few extra hours </u></p><p>Studies have demonstrated that individuals who cut their sleep down to five hours during the week but make up for it on the weekend with extra sleep, still pay a cost! </p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52); font-size: 16px;">What promotes social jetlag?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52); font-size: 16px;"> </span></strong></p><p>Besides a busy schedule, social media in particular have emerged as a risk factor. </p><p><br></p><p>The reason for this is that many of us like to exchange some news, watch the latest holiday pictures of our friends or funny videos in the evening before going to bed. This, however, increases the likelihood of losing sleep, because: </p><ul><li>The exchange of exciting news will make us more awake again </li><li>Once in hand, we often find it difficult to put the phone away and spend we spend a lot of valuable time being hijacked from sleep </li><li>Exposure to artificial lighting emitted by the screens of the TV, tablets, computers, mobiles etc., can adversely impact sleeping behaviour and sleep continuity by inhibiting melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone </li><li>Especially among teenagers the evening hours are popular, to socialise or relax and they prefer to go to bed later. To still have enough restorative sleep they needed to sleep in later in the morning than younger children. </li></ul><p>However, as our schooling system usually does not allow time for late mornings, this can also lead to social jetlag. </p><p><br></p><p>A fact that is reflected in impaired mental and cognitive performances among many pupils and students. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Hence, many sleep scientists urge that all this is to be taken into account when it comes to the management and structure of everyday school life. </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p></body></html>
