<html><head></head><body><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Narcolepsy </span>is a chronic neurological disorder that severely disrupts the body’s sleeping and waking cycles. It is characterized by extreme daytime drowsiness and is caused by abnormalities in the central nervous system and emerges in most cases in childhood to young adulthood. </p><p><br></p><p>It affects the systems in the brain that help us stay awake, such as the brain stem and hypothalamus. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The most prominent symptoms of this condition are <strong>sleep attacks</strong> (in which the desire to fall asleep is overwhelming), <strong>cataplexy</strong> (sudden bouts of muscle weakness), and <strong>sleep paralysis</strong> (a temporary inability to move while falling asleep or waking up).</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Frequent Symptoms</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The hallmark of the condition (everyone with narcolepsy has it), EDS causes people to become extremely drowsy during the day, leading to sleep attacks. It arises regardless of how much sleep a person gets.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">These are short periods in which the desire to sleep comes on quickly and is insatiable. In between sleep attacks, narcoleptic people feel rested and alert.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Cataplexy</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">A significant portion of narcolepsy cases also entails cataplexy. This sudden bout of muscle weakness, absence of muscle tone, and loss of voluntary motion often arise when a narcoleptic person experiences strong emotional responses, as in laughter, pangs of fear or stress, or sudden excitement.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The severity of this condition ranges, with some experiencing only a few of these attacks in a lifetime, while others have multiple episodes a day.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Sleep Paralysis</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Arising when narcoleptic people are close to falling asleep or just waking up, sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to perform voluntary movements or speak. A condition that lasts anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, it resembles cataplexy and the state of the body when people are in the dream state of sleep (called REM).</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">As with these conditions, the debilitation isn’t permanent and doesn’t have lingering effects; people quickly regain the ability to speak and move as expected.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><br></p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Hallucinations</span></li></ul><p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px;">Vivid hallucinations often accompany sleep paralysis and may arise when a narcoleptic person is falling asleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or shortly after waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations). These are most often visual in nature—though other senses can also be affected—and they may take on a frightening or jarring character.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span data-resolvable-asset="true" data-type="spr-social-media-asset-photo" data-assetid="66e01e976786193b8ead6d34"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/3010077616423/original/NxoMoQYNxTNPwaVFYS9G-KkiNmnHDNy_Vw.jpg?1641462731" style="width: 475px;max-width: 100%;" class="fr-dib" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="3010077616423"></span></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">While the symptoms themselves aren’t lethal, they’re certainly disruptive, and they can cause car accidents, falls, or other issues. If you or someone is experiencing EDS or other symptoms—the recommendation is to always seek professional help and the best would be a Sleep Expert doctor.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Treatments</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there is no cure for narcolepsy, but medications and behavioural treatments can improve/help to cope with symptoms. </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">There is a drug commonly prescribed to help with daytime sleep attacks.
