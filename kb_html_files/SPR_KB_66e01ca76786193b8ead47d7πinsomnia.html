Meaning, patients provide enough time for rest (e.g. 7-9 hours at night) but cannot produce sufficient sleep quantity or quality. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Insomnia can be divided into specific sub-types, although they are not mutually exclusive, which means they might occur together or separately: </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><strong>Onset Insomnia</strong>: Difficulty falling asleep </li><li><strong>Maintenance Insomnia</strong>: difficulty staying asleep </li></ul><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">To be <span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);"><strong>diagnosed</strong></span> with insomnia it must occur <span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">at least three nights each week for more than three months</span> (to separate insomnia from temporary sleep problems), <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">lead to significant stress</span> or <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">daytime impairment</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">stand independent from other mental disorders or medical conditions</span> that could otherwise cause sleep disturbance (e.g. depression, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes). </p><p dir="ltr"><span data-resolvable-asset="true" data-type="spr-social-media-asset-photo" data-assetid="66e01e976786193b8ead6d38"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/3010077622865/original/dqy-Hn4IYzJ02979abuUsniCw__8Z5-oTw.png?1641465550" style="width: 312px;max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fil fr-dii" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="3010077622865"></span></p><p>Prevalence rates of insomnia are estimated at 1<u>0-30% of adults</u>; however, rates are likely to be far more widespread with women affected twice as often as men. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The two most common<strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);"> triggers</span></strong> of insomnia are <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">emotional concerns</span> or<span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);"> worry</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">emotional distress </span>or <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">anxiety</span>. </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p>On the biological level, emotional arousal leads to an overactive sympathetic nervous system, which controls the body’s fight-or-flight mechanism, resulting in increased heart rate, blood flow, metabolic rate, brain activity, and release of the stress-negotiating hormone cortisol.
