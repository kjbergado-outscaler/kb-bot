If they do not, the case will get unassigned until the case handling has been finalized (no matter which status was inserted, even awaiting response).</p><p class="export-block__parent "></p><p class="export-block__parent ">This happens because any agent can handle the case later, it doesn&#x27;t stay with one person only. The only exception is if we are pending on the customer, and they reply in less than 8 hours. If this is the case, it system will automatically re-assign the case to the same agent as before. </p><p class="export-block__parent "></p>
