This leads to a <u>decrease in oxygen</u> content in the blood and <u>sleep fragmentation</u>.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">It usually affects men aged between 40 and 70 years old. It also commonly occurs in elderly individuals and those suffering from obesity. In general, this sleep disorder can be divided into three categories:</p><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Obstructive apnea: This involves real airway obstruction.</li><li dir="ltr">Central apnea: In this case, the malfunctioning of the respiratory activity is due to a temporary loss of the nervous stimulus on the way to the respiratory muscles.</li><li dir="ltr">Mixed apnea: This last type is simply a mix of the two previous types of apnea.</li></ul><p></p><p><span data-resolvable-asset="true" data-type="spr-social-media-asset-photo" data-assetid="66e01e976786193b8ead6d30"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/3010077354085/original/5yrYnDFQJLK1zv8hoFIJrfudQkqHnn2ovg.png?1641224416" style="width: 472px;max-width: 100%;" class="fr-dib" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="3010077354085"></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Symptoms and effects of sleep apnea</span></strong></span></p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Usually, the most common symptom of sleep apnea is <strong>snoring</strong>. In fact, due to the dysfunction of the breath, this becomes stronger. For example, prolonged breathing pauses, groans, and puffs are observed in sleepers who suffer from sleep apnea.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The causes of sleep apnea can vary, but aggravating factors include the use of sedatives, hypothyroidism, nasal obstruction, or the supine position during sleep.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The effects of this disorder may include<strong> difficulty falling asleep at night</strong>, <strong>excessive tiredness during the day</strong>, <strong>frequent headaches,</strong> and <strong>concentration problems</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, it has also been identified as a risk factor for other clinical consequences such as systematic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Studies have also shown that men suffering from sleep apnea have significantly lower levels of the hormone testosterone than those of a matching comparison sample not suffering from sleep apnea.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Risk factors associated with sleep apnea that might increase vulnerability for the disorder. The risk factors are advancing age, male sex, obesity, family history, menopause, craniofacial abnormalities, heavy cigarette smoking, and alcohol use.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(60, 65, 150);">Medical treatment and advice</span></strong></span></p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Although sleep apnea is recognized as a serious disease, it often stays undetected. Here, sleeping partners or familiars can help to report any abnormalities during the night (e.g. heavy snoring, breathing problems/pauses during sleep). </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><u>Early recognition</u> helps appropriate and effective <u dir="ltr">therapy</u>, counteracting serious health consequences.</p><p><br></p><p>Treatment of milder forms of sleep apnea includes weight reduction, quitting smoking, maintenance of a regular sleep pattern, or treatment of nasal allergies to support better breathing at night. </p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">If symptoms do not improve or in case of severe sleep apnea, various treatments/devices are possible: the most common and reliable method is CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), a machine you put on before going to bed which delivers air pressure through a mask to keep the upper airway passages open. Others are oral appliances designed to keep your throat open, or supplemental oxygen machines to counteract a shortage of oxygen during sleep. But these are only a few examples of a range of possible treatment methods.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100);"><br></span></strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);">Fun-fact</span></strong></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Snoring is a problem that makes no economic distinction.

It is a relatively uncommon parasomnia mainly affecting males. Sexsomnia happens during non-REM sleep and is not linked to dreaming. Although aberrant sexual activity during sleep was initially reported in 1989, the term ‘sexsomnia’ wasn’t created until 2003 when 11 individuals displaying sexual activities during sleep were recorded. Treatments that enhance the quality of sleep may help decrease the occurrence of incidents</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></body></html>
