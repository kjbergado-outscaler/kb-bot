The suppression of melatonin by natural/artificial light is hence intended and called for during the day as it promotes <strong>attention</strong>, <strong>alertness</strong>, and <strong>mood</strong>. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span data-resolvable-asset="true" data-type="spr-social-media-asset-photo" data-assetid="66e01da36786193b8ead53ef"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/3010078173151/original/H_Q-GWUVmil5ZiacCwNdeG8CtyNvlAHPRA.png?1642020860" style="width: auto;max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fil fr-dib" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="3010078173151"></span></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><em>(Illustration showing levels of <span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">cortisol</span> (stress hormone which makes us stay awake during the day), in blue connected with bluish light emitted by the full moon shown on the left window, and levels of<span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52);"> melatonin</span> (relax hormone which makes us sleep at night) in red connected with reddish light emitted by the half-moon shown on the right window.

We recommend starting the day with as much sunlight as possible and avoiding blue light in the evening. This may help to get (back) in sync with your own circadian rhythm.</span></pre><p><br></p><hr><h1 id="Blue-Light"><strong dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Blue Light</span></strong></h1><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Exposure to blue light, emitted by the screens of TV, tablets, computer, mobiles etc., can adversely impact sleeping behaviour and sleep continuity by inhibiting melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone.</p><p><br></p><p>A study conducted at Harvard University revealed that blue light suppresses the production of melatonin for twice as long as does green light.

Blue light exposure also elevated the core body temperature (however, a drop in core body temperature helps us to fall asleep and maintain sleep) and heart rate (which also lowers when we calm down and fall asleep).</p><p><br></p><p>A study showed that participants who read an e-book before bedtime took an average of nearly 10 min longer to fall asleep compared to individuals who read a printed book.

Additionally, to help the body's internal clock reset we recommend expsoure to natural light in the nature: Take out your camping gear and venture into the wilderness for a weekend! </p><p><br></p><h1 id=""><br></h1><p><br></p><p><br></p></body></html>
