Agent Operations,Sprinklr,What to do: Cases reverting to Unassigned Status,"Sometimes a ticket may switch to an ""Unsassigned"" Status, even after an agent has handled it. Like the example below: ​ What is the reason for this? After an agent handles the case, they have to complete the necessary ACW. If they do not, the case will get unassigned until the case handling has been finalized (no matter which status was inserted, even awaiting response). This happens because any agent can handle the case later, it doesn't stay with one person only. The only exception is if we are pending on the customer, and they reply in less than 8 hours. If this is the case, it system will automatically re-assign the case to the same agent as before.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/sprinklr/sprinklr,Tue Nov 18 03:55:55 UTC 2025
Claims,Logistic Claim,Logistic Claims,"Emma Learning Hub Training: here (do not use until further notice) Release Note: this article replaces ""Claims: Logistic claims"". Added guide on how to register a logistic claim . Added ​Logistic Claim: How to verify if the order was shipped incorrectly TABLE OF CONTENTS Logistic Claim: What ​ Logistic Claim: How to register How to: Submit a Logistic Claim in Sprinklr Claim Reasons Lost In Transit Incorrect Shipment Damages Carrier Misbehaviour Documentation Needed Logistic Claim: What Logistic claims are complaints of the customers related to inconveniences experienced during the delivery/return of the products that they’ve ordered. Claims can lead to a cancellation, return, replacement, or even monetary compensation (which is a possible refund of a certain amount of the cost paid by the Customer, based on the country-specific Compensation matrix). ​ ​ Claim Reasons Customers may reach us for multiple reasons, whether it be a carrier misbehavior, or due to an item never being received (as a lost item by the carrier, for example). IMPORTANT: a delay in delivery should not be logged as a logistic Claim, but instead, under WIMO category. First Decision to take: What is the reason of the customer claim? You can find below the reasons you may face when handling a logistic claim and an explanation of when to use each of them. In the dropdown you'll be able to under ​ Lost In Transit When the customer may get a notification of receiving the product, but they contact us informing that they didn't received (a whole parcel is missing (not part of a product - that would be a product claim ). There is a miscommunication between both parties and we need to take the required actions depending on the situation. ​ 1. Types of Lost In Transit cases: Lost or stolen: A tracking number is available in the OMS and it works on the carrier website. However, the tracking update states ""delivered"" but the customer didn't received the product or one of the items they should've ( OBS : here we consider items under the same fulfillment and tracking number, meaning: items that should've arrived altogether ). ​ Lost in transit: In that case, a tracking number is available in the OMS and it works on the carrier website. However, the latest update on the carrier website was over 10 days ago (e.g. the website says that the parcel is in transit). ​ No tracking possible : A tracking number is available in the OMS and it works on the carrier. However, there has never been any update on the carrier website (e.g. the website says that the order information has been transmitted and status is like this for >10 days ago). ​ Market exception: For CH orders please consider a timeline of 20 days instead of 10 to accommodate special operational delays related to customs & warehouse expeditions in the country. No supplement should be created for Lost in Transit and No tracking Possible before the 20 days. ​ 2. Actions to perform: Identify if the parcel can be considered lost: check the parcel status (and the time that it's stuck on it) in the carrier tracking portal or Order Status Page. Pay attention if there's any sort of observation related to the order, e.g: incorrect address, or an attempt of delivery that failed and they will try to reship the product. If so, this shouldn't be considered a claim. Just clarify with the customer what happened and the next steps. ​ Check the proof of shipment/delivery if the customer didn't received the item and the tracking says ""delivered"": legally, carriers must deliver the product only for the buyer or authorized people to receive it, with a signature available upon delivery time. This document should be available to our Customer service teams. Where to find this document can vary depending on the market partner's website. If no proof of shipment is available, we must consider the claim of the customer valid and assume the shipment was incorrectly delivered. ​ If the proof of shipment is available but it has no signature/signature is not clear, send what we have to the customer and check if they recognize it. If they do, it's not a logistic claim. If they don't, also assume that the shipment was incorrectly delivered. ​ Actions: On incorrect deliveries, we require a legally binding declaration signed by the customer (RVE Template). You also must attach the proof of shipment - a screenshot of the delivery status as per the reference by the end of this article (Parcel Perform screenshot). If you need to manually add the documentation to the ticket and don't know how: review the article Sprinklr: How to handle tickets. ​ ​ Please contact the carrier if the parcel is stuck in the same status for >10 days. Ask about the order using this link . If carrier replies with a delivery date, inform costumer accordingly (once the order arrives, customer may be eligible for compensation - check the rules). If it doesn't reply or status don't change in 2 business days, please follow the same process of the items that have the status ""delivered"" but never arrived. ​ If the item is considered lost: please check with the customer if they would like us to re-ship the item by creating a supplement (check here ).  The other option would be to cancel and to do a full refund. For this, please refer to the following table: Fluent – Fulfillment Status Order Status Action and team ON FLUENT COMMERCE: Ready for dispatch/Dispatched/ Arrived at sorting center/Out for delivery/Requested for delivery option/Lost order/Delivery delay/Picked up/AT_DEPOT BUT THE CARRIER TRACKING WEBSITE SHOWS: Lost or Missing ​ Shipped Open a Jira here Use the Refund Topic ""Cancel and Refund"" with the reason for refund ""Cancellation"" Make sure to attach the proof of order being Lost (screenshot of carrier tracking or carrier confirmation). ​ ON FLUENT COMMERCE: Complete Complete with Proof of Delivery (screenshot of Proof of Delivery from carrier) Open a Jira here ​ ​ Use the Refund Topic ""Refund Initiation"" with the reason for refund ""Cancellation"" Make sure to attach proof of Delivery and clarify why it's not valid or if not available at all, validating the claim from customer. IMPORTANT: it’s mandatory to attach any proof that the order was Delivered and claimed Lost by customer, or proof of it being Lost by the carrier on their page, otherwise OM and Refund team will reject your request. ​ Incorrect Shipment When an incorrect SKU is delivered to the customer. How to verify if order was shipped incorrectly Request label pictures from the customer Compare the SKU on the label with the one listed in Fluent: ​ According to your findings, follow one of the scenários below: A. Same SKU - Correct shipment If it’s the same SKU → Correct product shipped, the order was shipped correctly . Do not supplement, as the same item will likely be sent again. If the customer does not want to keep the item → process a return with refund. B. Different SKU - Incorrect shipment If it’s a different SKU → the wrong product was shipped, order was shipped incorrectly .​ ​ For minor issues (e.g., color variation), offer compensation, for the customer to keep the item. If customer accepts, request the refund via Jira to ARD2C 1 . ​ If customer does not accept the compensation , or it is not applicable: Check stock for the correct item (same SKU) 2 . If there is stock , supplement the correct product if customer agrees If there is no stock Check the replacement matrix for a similar SKU 3 , and check it's stock: If there is a similar SKU and stock is available → offer the customer the possibility of supplement similar Sku. If they accept it, process the supplement and create a return without refund for the original item; If there is a similar SKU , but stock is not available → return with refund ​ If customer does not wish to receive a supplement: Process a return with refund, if they are still within the trial period 4 Note : Anything that falls outside this flow, please raise to your supervisor (note: make sure you followed every available step before raising the case) Need help with any of the steps? Check the dropdowns below (third-pane view, only): How to: issue Logistic Claims Compensation via JIRA 1 How to: Check Stock Availability 2 Ref: Replacement matrix 3 How to: check if order is within trial period 4 ​ ​ ​2. Actions to perform If something was delivered wrong, we need to make sure the wrong item is returned to our warehouse and the proper ordered one is reshipped as a supplement order (zero cost for the customer). ​ Damages Logistic Claims related to the quality of the package during the delivery time. ​ 1. Types of Damages: Product & Box damaged/Product damaged during assembly : when the box/package is damaged and the product inside as well, it means that the damage happened during the delivery and the item will need to be replaced by a new product. If the product was damaged during the assembly, the process is the same. ​ Package damaged, product intact : if only the box is damaged, we guarantee the quality of the product and it should not be replaced and customer should not be compensated either . For exceptions, please ensure you follow your market-related guidelines. ​ OBS: If the box is intact but the product inside is damaged, we consider it a quality issue, which falls under product claims. ​ 2. Actions to perform: Please refer to the article [Online: D2C: EU] Product & Logistic Claims : Damage & Incomplete item(s) . Carrier Misbehaviour When the carrier inappropriately or fails to comply with expected standards during the delivery or handling of the goods. 1. Types of Carrier Misbehaviour cases: Additional service not provided : The extra service was not provided by the carrier (dis-/assembly service, old mattress removal, room of choice delivery, did not show up to pickup/return appointment). Carrier unprofessional behavior: The customer complains about rude or unprofessional behavior from the carrier which does not cause any monetary damage (e.g. confrontations or inappropriate interactions with customer). Delivered to wrong address/wrong person but customer received the product : The product was initially delivered to a different person or different address but the customer received the product in the end. Property damaged - financial cost : The carrier damages the customer's property during the delivery or collection of products, resulting in monetary damage. Property damaged - no cost : The carrier damaged the customer's property during the delivery or collection of products, but the customer does not provide an invoice and does not suffer from monetary damage. Returned without delivery attempt : Customer claims the carrier did not ring the bell or leave any note. No re-delivery attempt. The carrier did not ring the bell or leave any note or there's no re-delivery attempt. 2. Actions to perform: Is the costumer claiming a cost/asking for a reattempt? If the answer is yes : For property damage : the customer will need to sign an RVE (Legal Binding declaration) template, to provide a picture of the damage, a picture of the repair and an invoice for the repair costs. Also, when filling the claim in the Guided Workshow in Sprinklr, you'll also be asked to input a screenshot from the carrier website of current status. As soon as it's done, you'll need to open a ticket on the ARD2C Jira. If the repair <100€ (invoice), supervisor can approve, for repair >100€, please Emma internals to get approval before promissing payment to the customer. Please leave notes of the case. For additional service not provided : If the service was expected to be provided (e.g., requested by the customer or advertised by Emma), please contact the carrier to ensure its fulfillment. If that happens, we don't offer compensation. But, if the customer contact us explaining that the carrier did not assemble the product but he did, please offer a maximum value of 25 euros in compensation by filling a ticket to the ARD2C team. Please leave a note on the case mentioning which service was not provided, when, why it wasn't provided, if the customer was contacted by the carrier and how the case was solved. For returned without delivery attempt : please review the Tracking information on Order Status Page or the Tracking website of the carrier. If the carrier failed to provide/provided inconsistent information for the customer and the item was Returned to Sender, proceed with supplementing the order. ​ If the answer is no : it generally means that the customer is upset by the carrier standards but there's no damage in the product. In that case, we don't offer compensation, but you should still create a logistic claim for incident report and leave notes on Sprinklr (what happened, when, where, specify in which way did the carrier behave unprofessionally) Please apologize the customer for the unmet expectations and thank them for bringing the topic to our attention. Inform them that we will leave the records of the claims in our system and that our logistic team will take this up and improve the services. ​ ​ Logistic Claim: How to register Logistic claims must be logged using the Guided Worfklow in Sprinklr. ​ ​ ​ How to: Submit a Logistic Claim in Sprinklr ​ Documents and templates Legally Binding Declaration (RVE Template): ​ What is it? It is a signed statement from the customer that is used to officially confirm events such as: non-receipt of products, damaged or tampered packages or unauthorized charges or deliveries. Once signed, the person becomes responsible for the accuracy of the information and could face legal consequences if it's false. When to send the RVE to customer? When the customer claims the product has not been delivered and if the tracking doesn't clearly state that the parcel was not returned to the sender. How to send it? RVE forms can only be sent and received via email, and will need to be sent to and received from the same email address that is connected to the order in question on OMS. Each market will have a document in your customers' language to attach to the Logistic Claim, please find the RVE forms: here . Notes: BR market can be covered by the PT Template AU market can be covered by the EN Template MX; CL and CO markets can be covered by the spanish Template ​ ​ ​ Proof of Shipment What is it? A proof of shipment is a screenshot (of ""Track Order"" on ParcelPerform or the status part on the Carriers Tracking Page) that confirms the delivery. When to use it? If the customer signs a legally binding declaration, you should always attach the Proof of Delivery as well when filling the Logistic Claim. It will look like this: Market exception : For FR, a picture of the customer's ID is also required. However, in these cases, the unnecessary details on the ID card should be redacted/covered, since we only need the name and signature to open the carrier investigation. ​ pdf Claim Management - Logistic (final).pdf 0.22 MB png M6.3 Logistic Claims 2.0.png 0.09 MB",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/claims/logistic-claims,Tue Nov 18 14:09:59 UTC 2025

How old is the bed? Oftentimes, what seems to be an issue with the mattress, is actually caused by an issue with the bed. To address the root cause, we need to be sure the product issue is not caused by a bad state of the bed. Please put the mattress on a flat floor. This is needed to ensure we can a) spot any deviations, and b) be sure the issue is not caused by the bed. Please take off the cover of the mattress.

Offer the customer two options: Option 1: Compensation Offer the customer a compensation, according to the compensation matrix . Explain to the customer that ""The raised issue does not affect the usage of the product."" Because the product didn't match the customer's expectations, you can offer them a compensation.

Initiate a return to have the customer send us back the faulty item. Outcome of the claim = ""Return and supplement created"" If the product is no longer usable Proceed to the 'Decision point 2'. Decision point 2: Can this issue be resolved by sending a spare part? You must first decide if this issue can be resolved by sending a spare part.

That way, the customer will be sure to receive a replacement. Option 1: Same SKU is available for replacement Replace the faulty item with a new one, by Creating a supplement, AND Initiating a return of the faulty item. Need a reminder how to create supplements? Review the information here . ​ Outcome of the claim = ""Return and supplement created"" ​ Option 2: No supplement is available Go to the next decision step 'Is a comparable SKU available'?

Claims,Product Claim,Product Claims: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Product Claims,"1. What if the customer does not have a product label on their product? Mattresses or Toppers should have 3 Product Labels, one on the core, one on the foil and one on the box, they all look the same. If none of them is available, the customer should take a picture of the Cover Label. Beds or Slatted Frames should have a Product Label on every Packaging Box and an additional Label on the main assembly parts (Bed Base, Headboard, Slatted Frame). The customer should take a picture of one of it. ​ ​ Foam Pillows should have 2 Product Labels, one on the foam product and one on the Cover, both need to be provided. If the customer cannot find them, they should take a picture of the Label on the Box. Microfiber Products, Bedding Sheets, Smart Sleeves and Weighted Blankets should have 1 Product Label, on the Product itself. If the customer cannot find them, they should take a picture of the Label on the Box. 2. Why do we need to ask the customer to share so many pictures and details about the defect? All information from the customer about the defect will be used by the manufacturing supplier to identify the root cause and implement preventive actions. The picture of the label is needed to verify and hold the supplier accountable for their products. If we do not have pictures to forward to the supplier we cannot improve the quality and more importantly cannot claim back the money from our manufacturing suppliers for defective products. Claims Flow FAQ 1. If required is it possible to upload video format files? Yes, any data type can be uploaded during the flow including video files 2. If there is a claim regarding more than 1 item, will the agent need to open more than one claim? Yes, it's one claim per item, the only exception will be for logistic claim (Carrier misbehaviour), but for Product claims always one claim per item 3. What information is expected to add to the ""Claim comment""? Add any additional relevant information shared by the customer besides the claim reason 4. Is it still needed to complete the tagging, barcode/FAR during the ACW? No, these are now inserted during the claims flow and not during the ACW. 5. Is it possible to see the pictures inside the claim? Yes, as long as the claim is still pending, in that case agents can update the claim, once they select the previous claim they will see all the information about the claim including links for the previous pictures submited. Note: If you select the option to update a claim, you will need to resubmit the previous pictures otherwise they will be deleted from the claim",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/claims/product-claims,Wed Nov 12 06:10:03 UTC 2025

Customer Inquiry,Cancellation,Return to Sender process,"Key-words Return; Return to Sender; Unable to Deliver; Delivery Rejection In this article you'll find information about how to deal with customers reaching out about fulfillments with a Return to Sender status (often associated with Late Cancellations, Rejected Delivery or Unable to Deliver cases). Table of content Definition Instructions Closing the loop Definition A shipment is considered returned to the sender when the delivery failed, and the carrier was not able to complete successfully the shipment. An order can be sent to the sender (fully or partially) for several reasons: Late cancellation : customers changed their mind about the purchase when it was too late to cancel it on Fluent. Delivery rejected: customer could reject the delivery for the reason above or because they were not the recipient of the order. Impossibility to find the address/ customer not home: some details were wrong or missing, or customer was not at home when the delivery was. For all the scenarios above, we are willing to refund customers for the value of the order that they haven’t received. As this is not an automated process, it’s important for the customer support agent to identify correctly these cases to provide a seamless and smooth refund experience for our customers. For all the scenarios above, no supplement order should be created. Exceptions If it’s a return to sender case and the customer still wants the order, claiming they didn’t receive any information about the delivery or attempted delivery, please check Parcel Lab, the Order Status Page, and the tracking link to verify what information the carrier has provided. If the carrier did failed to provide clear information to the customer or in the system, proceed with the supplement process under the Logistic Claim flow (it can be due to lost parcel or carrier misbehaviour if it's not customer's fault). If you feel like your customer has an exceptional situation and needs further escalation, please with your Supervisor if you should involve Emma Internal team. Instructions Validate the fulfillment status Most of the cases, when an order is returned to the sender it will be reflected on Fluent, under the fulfillment tab with the input “return_to_sender_complete” (it will appear on where there's the ""picked_up"" highlighted in green). If this status is not updated on Fluent always make sure to check the tracking page of the carrier , to confirm if, at least on their website, the information is updated. If it is (carrier page confirms the return was return to sender) , please take a screenshot that will be needed to inform Order Management (OM) team (delivery rejected, returned to sender) to cancel the order/fulfillment. If is not , and the tracking doesn’t show the order as returned, please contact the carrier to have updates on this delivery. Only when you receive a written confirmation that the order was returned to the sender, then you can move forward with opening the Jira to correct team. Action to take For the returns to sender process, based on the information you have available on Fluent and on the tracking page of the carrier, you’ll need to reach ARD2C team or OM team with their proper Jira. Please follow the table below: Fluent – Fulfillment Status Order Status Action and team ON FLUENT COMMERCE: Ready for dispatch Dispatched Arrived at sorting center Out for delivery Requested for delivery option Lost order Delivery delay Picked up AT_DEPOT BUT THE CARRIER TRACKING WEBSITE SHOWS: Delivery rejected Returned to sender Shipped Open a Jira here Use the Refund Topic ""Cancel and Refund"" with the reason for refund ""Cancellation"" Make sure to attach the proof of order being Returned to Sender (screenshot of carrier tracking or carrier confirmation). ​ ON FLUENT COMMERCE: Complete Return to Sender complete Complete with return to sender proof (screenshot from carrier page) Return_to_sender_complete Open a Jira here Use the Refund Topic ""Refund Initiation"" with the reason for refund ""Cancellation"" Make sure to attach proof of order Returned to Sender (screenshot of status showing in Fluent Commerce) Important note: it’s mandatory to attach any proof that the order was returned to sender, otherwise OM and Refund team will reject your request. Closing the loop If you’ve followed correctly the process, OM and Refund team will take care of the refund request.

Customer Inquiry,Compensation,Logistic Claims & Order Delays Compensation Matrix - European markets,"​ Release Note: 21/10/2025: This article is now Logistic Claims & Order Delays only: references to Product Claim compensation Matrix removed ​ Introduction In this article, you can find an explanation about what is the Compensation Matrix for all European markets and how to use it. The EU Matrix was created to set a standard and manage the compensation values that Emma offers to customers in specific situations. Also, now we have 2 versions of the Compensation Matrix: one for regular cases that the CS agents handle; and the second one ONLY to be used by HLE/PRIO1 agents that handle the cases from the High-Level Escalations queues. Additionally we also have the compensation feature for Delivery delay claims. (Live since April 24th) ATTENTION : The compensation should be given per order (or item/SKU, if it's the case), but not per complaint . If there are multiple complaints, the most severe complaint should be chosen. The only exception is when there's a Logistic Claim and a Product Claim (check on the FAQs). Reasons to offer compensation Before starting using the Compensation Matrix, it is necessary to understand which cases and scenarios are valid for a compensation to be offered to the customers. ​ Logistics Claims compensations A logistics claim can only be made if the customer complaint is regarding a damaged packaging and/or product, products lost in transit, carrier misbehavior during delivery or during the collection of products, or incorrect shipment . Logistic Claims - Compensation Reason Reason Category Discount Discount condition Damages Package (only) damaged NO Product damaged YES compensation matrix If the customer keeps the damaged product Incorrect Shipment Wrong Product/SKU Shipped YES compensation matrix If the customer keeps the item with the wrong SKU.

Always when the customer receives the order. Please don't mention %s, just calculate the full value with the OD calculator (as we can do regular updates on the minimum and maximum values). What's the step-by-step process for providing compensation for an order delay? When an order is delayed, we should inform the customer of the new Updated Delivery Date (if applicable). If there is no UDD information (invalid date), we should warn them that we don't expect the order to arrive in less than 8 weeks. Always let them know that we offer compensation after 14 days of delay. If they are willing to wait and be compensated, ask them to alert us as soon as they receive the order so we can calculate the compensation. Please avoid mentioning specific compensation rates. ​ Should we roundup the compensation values (ex. if it's 61.77€, offer 65€): Only cents, for example: if it's 35.62, offer 36€. Ideally we should always offer the exact values that appear in the OD calculator. What to do if acustomer ordered a product with assembly included and the carrier didn't assemble during the delivery? The correct process is to contact the carrier in order to schedule a new assemble. If that happens, we don't offer compensation. But, if the customer contact us explaining that the carrier did not assemble the product but he did, please offer a maximum value of 25 euros in compensation. Can I provide the maximum of compensation for Order Delays whenever I believe the customer should have it? No. For Order Delays, taking into account the compensation percentages in each bucket and the maximum values, the compensation will always be the lowest value between the two. Example: if the compensation value is 45€, but the maximum value for the bucket in the file is 50€, we will still pay 45€. Can the customer cancel the order due to a delay? Yes, but if they have received compensation for a delay, this must be deducted from the full refund. Should we offer compensation for the entire order or on a per-item basis if only one item (SKU) is delayed? If the situation is not with the entire order and we have the price split per item in OMS, we should be able to compensate on an item specific level. One example is a customer that bought a bundle with a bed, mattress and pillow. If there's a delay with only the pillow, the agent needs to specify the SKU that requires compensation in the Order 2 Cash Jira portal in order for us to compensate the customer just for the pillow's delay. What to do when the order/item value is low and therefore offering the minimum compensation is still a lot? On W26, 2024 we decided to lower the minimum values to address this situation. An example is a $30 order where the reward for scenario 2 is 5% ($1.5). Considering that our minimum payout is $5, we should still pay $5. Do we have to transfer the tickets to the HLE queue? No, you shouldn't need to transfer it. As stated, we should provide compensation ONCE the order is delivered to the customer. We understand that the prior process was to proactively compensate customers on some countries. For complaints that happen before June 5th, if repeating WIMO for +3 times (3 wrong updated delivery dates) in the same order, it's possible to transfer to the HLE queue. Before transferring it, please ensure that the item is not phased out (if applicable to your country) and write an internal note explaining why the ticket was escalated to the HLE queue. What if the customer doesn't accept the compensation values? The compensation values are final and if the customer don't agree he can always cancel the order and get a full refund. The only exception is if it's a regular CS case but it's a legal threat. If this is the case, please escalate the situation to your TL and If he agrees, please open the ticket explaining that it's a legal threat, then it's possible to use the HLE Compensation Matrix instead of the regular EU CS one. If we have initiated a compensation and the customer wants to cancel their order, do we refund them the full amount or do we deduct the compensation value from the full price? We will deduct the compensation value from the full price. Will HLE initiate the compensation or will they reassign the ticket to our queue with an approval? They will initiate the refund. If the customer was promised an incorrect amount by a previous agent according to the previous policy, what do we do? Send proof in Jira that the date of the promised compensation is before May 25th, 2024. If a wrong product was shipped and there is a price difference that should be refunded to the customer, what should we do? If a customer places an order for $1,000 and mistakenly receives a similar product that costs $800 and wants to keep the product, we will refund the difference between the two ($200) plus the compensation for the $800 product. If the customer doesn't want to keep the product, they can return it as normal. ​",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/compensation,Fri Nov 14 13:00:14 UTC 2025

It can only be used in the early post-purchase stage (before the delivery, while fulfillment is pending/waiting for stock). Typical triggers: original product is phased out, out of stock (OOS) with no UDD or UDD >14 days after PDD, or customer requests a change in color/characteristics. The customer’s invoice is updated with the new item, but they pay nothing extra. ​ ​ Key differences between Replacements & Supplements ​ Aspect ​Free Replacement (Pre-Delivery) Supplements (Post-Delivery) Purpose ​ Replace with better or updated item Add to solve an issue ​ Conditions ​ Tool can only used on a pre-delivery scenario, until fulfillment status is ""Pending"" or ""Waiting for Stock"" Items needs to be a standalone - not composite (beds, sofa beds).  If an order has both, only the standalone items can be replaced. Agents should not replace an item more than once . Escalations or special cases should be reviewed by Emma internals.

What happens when it's a WIMO phone case? When a customer comes to us BY PHONE with a WIMO request (Where is my Order), the agent needs to investigate if / why there's a delay. A replacement can be evaluated if: there's a UDD and it's more than 14 Days from the PDD there's no UDD ​ Say to the customer in the call is that : ""Unfortunately there's a delay of X amount of days and that we'll analyze internally if there's any possible replacement options for his order. We will get back to them via email with two possible outcomes: If there are some options, we will share it with the link for them to check in the webshop and they like it, they will need to reply to us providing consent for the replacement. If there's no replacement available, we will inform them and let them know that they can always wait and be compensated for the amount of time that they waited or cancel the order as they wish. For compensation, once the order arrives, they need to contact us. ​ Should I offer a replacement or a compensation, if it's applicable on the case? If NO UDD or UDD > 14 days, you can offer both, if there’s a match on stock SKU on the replacement file. ​ Can a customer have a replacement and then be compensated? No. The options of replacement and compensation are not cumulative. We also cannot provide a compensation due to the time that they waited for the replacement to arrive. ​ What happens if, while I'm waiting for customer's response about a replacement, the original item status progresses it? Then the offer expires. This is a condition that appears on the offer's canned response. ​ ​ What's the main difference between proactive and reactive replacements? The main difference is that: For the reactive replacements, agents respond to customer requests and must validate and offer the replacement options, while For proactive replacements, bulk approach with a single predefined replacement and automatic cancellation if the customer does not respond within five days. ​ ​ ​ ​ Previous Versions: Last update: Summarize the last update and relevant changes.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/others,Sun Nov 02 11:35:36 UTC 2025

Customer Inquiry,Others,Discount Codes,"TABLE OF CONTENTS What is a discount code? Types of Discount Codes How to identify the different types of Discount Codes? Other specifics discount codes Common Codes inquiries from Customers 1) Code typo by customer 2) Discount information/ policy 3) Code not working How to handle when a Discount Code is not working? What to do with VALID Discount Codes? What to do with NOT VALID Corporate Discount Codes? What is a discount code? We have different ways to push customers to sales. Marketing teams from countries may create different campaigns to give a discount on the products/ order to incentive customers to close the deal with us. The coupon code can vary from campaign to campaign and usually go from 5 - 10%, depending on the specific strategy of the country. In some special cases, even more amounts of discounts can be offered. Types of Discount Codes As explained above, Emma can have different discounts active according to each country's team sales and marketing strategy. Some examples are: - Codes for Influencers; - S pecific seasonal campaigns (such as summer sales, or a specific holiday campaign); - Corporate Discount Codes; - Codes for Affiliates; - Marketing campaigns in media (as radio, tv, outdoors, etc). Or any other reason the marketing team may be able to use to engage customers with the DEAL button! How to identify the different types of Discount Codes? Specific discount codes The other discount codes mentioned above are created sporadically by our Marketing Team for promotional engagement actions or company partnerships. For example, the Corporate Discount Codes can be identified by starting as ""CORPXXXXXXX""; and influencer codes can be with their initial or even entire name, like ""TATAXX%"". The Marketing Team of each country is instructed to update our internal Newsletter to keep you informed about any new discounts. You can find more by checking the related links: AU Newsletter Australia NZ Newsletter New Zealand DE Newsletter Germany CH Newsletter Switzerland NL Newsletter Netherlands AT Newsletter Austria BE Newsletter Belgium BR Newsletter Brasil DK Newsletter Denmark SE Newsletter Sweden ESP Newsletter Spain PT Newsletter Portugal These are sent to customers directly in different ways and not by our customer support team. However, you, as an Emmie, may need to help a customer that has an issue with one of these codes. Common Codes inquiries from Customers It may happen customers reach out to us to claim the discount code is not working and the discount expected has not been applied to the order. Today, the requests may be divided into: Code typo by customer; Discount information/ policy; Code - not working. Freshdesk Ticket Accuracy: Ensure you always provide the related Ticket type & subtype based on the customer request. Let's see in detail the 3 most Common Code questions from customers: 1) C ode typo by customer Some customers might reach out to us claiming the discount code is not working but this might be because they made a typo when adding the discount code. You should check if the customer is using the right coupon code, is the customer typing it properly? If not, provide the related valid one. 2) Discount information/ policy Some customers might reach out to us regarding the policy of the discount - what is the coupon code giving them as a benefit? How long is the discount code valid? Is the campaign for the coupon code still live? If not, explain to the customer the campaign has already finished and the discount code is not valid anymore. Check with your marketing strategy to check if you can proceed with a discount (price match). Follow the market procedure related to it. Specific policies: If the discount code is not valid to apply over an existing discount, explain the discount is not cumulative . Active coupon codes: Customers may reach out to know if there is any active discount code. As an example, you can always advise customers to subscribe to Emma's newsletter and they will be up to receive directly the promotions we do (some countries also include a code for subscription). 3) Code not working Some customers might reach out to you claiming the discount code is not working. It can happen eventually that the code is properly typed, but the customer doesn't see the discount reflected on the cart in the website. In those situations, we have to do some verification, but after checking that it's all right, we can provide a discount after the purchase for the customer. But first, let's check below all the steps to investigate the problem and the steps to handle Discount Code Issues. How to handle when a Discount Code is not working ? How to check if the Discount Code exists and is valid? If the customer claims the Code is not working, we need to understand if is a valid code. A ""valid code"" means that: 1) The code exist in our systems, so it was created by some team inside Emma; 2) It is still active; 3) It's being applied according to the Terms & conditions of the Code. To check all the 3 situations mentioned, you need to follow the process below: Option 2: If not found in Magento, check it on Talon.One ( How to find discounts in Talon.One ) Ans if it doesn't appear in Talon.One, it means that the code doesn't exist in our systems (it can mean that is a fake code, unfortunately). In the end of this article, you will see what to do in case the discount code that the customer has it's not valid. What to do with VALID Discount Codes? Even if the code is valid, it may not work for the customer and this will make them ask for your support: Step 1: Simulate a purchase on Emma's website (abiding by the code's T&Cs), apply the customer's code, and check if the discount is redeemed in the cart. Step 2: If works for you, but not for the customer, ask the customer to clear cookies & cache or try to access through an incognito window. Step 3: If after this, the code is still not working for the customer, ask the customer to send us the picture of the discount not applying , so we can validate and report the issue to the related team. Step 4: Once we receive this information and have confirmed that the claim is valid, we can advise the customer to go ahead and proceed with the order without the discount code . Make sure to explain to the customer that after the purchase, they should contact us, provide the order number and, once we verify that the order placed meets the voucher T&Cs, we will issue a partial refund in the amount that should have been given as a discount by the voucher. Step 5: After receiving the order confirmation, trigger the related discount manually the OMS (Magento or FluentCommerce). Review how to trigger the discount: Magento: what and how to or Fluentcommerce . Step 6: Send the discount confirmation to the customer after triggering it in the OMS. Manage customer expectations regarding refund time. IMPORTANT: The refund can only be done if the customer makes a purchase under the same conditions as indicated in Magento/Talon.One for the voucher. For example, if the code's conditions state that it can not be used with a product already in sale, the customer's order must not contain any products on sale, otherwise the refund cannot be issued. What to do with NOT VALID Corporate Discount Codes? Now, let's check what to do if it's confirmed that the code is not valid and non-existent in our system : Situation 1 - The code is invalid because it doesn't show in our systems: Answer to the customer: ""Unfortunately, after checking our system, we were not able to find the code in question. As such, we would r ecommend you to contact the site/company that provided you with this code, in order to clarify this situation"". Situation 2 - The code is invalid because it has expired (the customer contacted us after the expiration date): Answer to the customer: ""Unfortunately, after checking our system, we can confirm that the discount code in question is no longer valid, as it could only be used until XX/XX."" Situation 3 - The code was valid, but expired between the customer contacting us and our first reply. -> In this case, as a gesture of goodwill, we can advise the customer to go ahead and make the purchase. Explaining that after this, they should contact us, provide the order number and, once we verify that the order placed meets the voucher T&Cs, we will issue a partial refund in the amount that should have been given as a discount by the voucher.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/others,Tue Nov 18 13:12:44 UTC 2025

Customer Inquiry,Purchase Issues,VAT Exemption under UE Tax Law,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction VAT context VAT exemption conditions Guidelines for VAT exemption Introduction In this article, you will learn the correct procedure regarding VAT (Value Added Tax) exemption and how to deal with customer requests for exemption under the UE Tax Law exemptions. VAT context The customers that make a purchase on Emma's website have the option to input their VAT in the order for fiscal purposes. This is possible if is someone buying for their own use, or if the person represents a business and it's buying for the company. According to the UE Tax Law, when purchasing from a company from a different country, people can ask for a VAT exemption and have the VAT cost refunded. BUT this cannot be done at Emma! Let's understand better the reason why. VAT exemption conditions The VAT exemption can be done if the invoice given to customers is going with another country's VAT number than the one the customer is shipping the products to - again, not the case at Emma. This would only happen in case we allowed customers to buy on a country's website to deliver in a different country and that is not allowed on our checkout. Invoices are not being corrected automatically on OMS and workarounds for this are not compliant (not to mention the tax on the refund). Guidelines for VAT exemption -> Under NO circumstances we should accept VAT exemption at Emma under the UE Tax Law. -> Emma only allows website sales to be delivered to addresses of the countries for the correspondent markets. -> Once the VAT on the invoice will be on the same market, it makes it a non-intracommunity purchase. -> If the customer request further clarification, we can guide them to the website of VIES (VAT Information Exchange System): here",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/purchase-issues,Mon Nov 10 09:17:33 UTC 2025

Check if the invoice is available Refund status is ""Error"" Refund status is ""Without"" Refund Timeline Overview Once a customer has completed the return of their product, refund will be processed by Refunds Team in Magento within 3-5 business days; however, there are instances where a refund is still pending after 5 business days, thus, having refund follow-up tickets from the customer. This article will help the Customer Service Agents to handle refund follow-up for Product Return. Checking the refund status in Magento These are the possible reasons in Magento why customer has not received their refund: Refund status is ""Pending"" - pending refunds will be refunded by Refunds Team within 3-5 business days Refund status is ""Without"" - this is not reflected on the pending list of Refunds Team, thus, will not be refunded Refund status is ""Error"" - an error has occurred in Magento due to some reason and refund has to be made manually Return status is not ""Complete"" - order is not yet due for refund since the return of the item is not yet complete; this is not reflected on the pending list of Refunds Team, thus, will not be refunded Order has no invoice - product return refund needs an invoice in order to create a credit memo for the refund If you have received a refund follow-up inquiry from the customer, go to Magento and check the return status. Refund status is ""Refunded"" If the refund status of the item returned is already tagged as ""Refunded"", this means that the refund was already processed and the amount should be received by the customer within 14 business days (except when using a credit card which takes 2-3 weeks). Please use a market-specific canned response to answer the customer's inquiry, if available. If the refund is still not received by the customer within 14 business days after the refund was processed in Magento, escalate the ticket to Refunds Emma. N ote: You can see the date when refund was processed in Magento by clicking ""Show History"" in Actions Column If a failed refund note is seen on the comments history, escalate the ticket to Refunds Emma.

Customer Inquiry,Refund,[Online:D2C:EU] Price-match,"Introduction This article will help you assist customer's requests for a price match—typically after they’ve placed an order and noticed the same item is now listed at a lower price on our website. This process is not applicable to CH , for this country please reject any price match request TABLE OF CONTENT ​ What a price-match is Why we price-match? ​ Important points before proceeding ​ ​ STEP 1 - Check the order status Order not yet delivered Order already delivered STEP 2 - Request the refund ​ Market Specific Guidelines ​ What a price-match is A price-match request is when a customer who has already placed an order (or attemped)—whether or not the items have shipped/delivered—discovers that the exact same product (identical SKU, colour, size, model, etc.) is now advertised on our website at a lower price. The customer reaches out and asks us to refund the difference so their final cost reflects the new, lower price. This situation typically occurs when the order was placed before a promotion went live and the markdown appears afterward. ​ Why do we price-match? This is a retention tool: it keeps the order (and the customer) with us instead of driving them toward a cancellation or return. The one-question test If the customer cancelled/returned today, could they immediately reorder the same identical item from us at a lower price? Yes → We should price-match. No → A price-match isn’t applicable; Honouring the lower price up front is more cost effective—and far friendlier—than processing a return shipment or cancelling the order. IMPORTANT points to consider before proceeding Trial-period only – We honour price-match requests solely within the customer’s trial window (e.g., the 100-night mattress trial). Exact item, no bundles/packs or give aways – Match the price only for the identical SKU. Bundle deals, free-gift promotions, are excluded. No external or store pricing – For now we don’t match prices from third-party retailers or Emma stores ( Except NL , check market specific guidelines) Market-specific rules – Some countries have additional conditions or caps. Always check the Market-Specific Policies section before confirming a match. Multiple drops, multiple price-matches – If the price drops more than once during the trial period and the customer requests it each time, grant every valid price-match request. Document in Fluent – Add a clear note for each refund Follow refund guidelines– Process the adjustment exactly as outlined in the refund guidelines to avoid rejections. Price matching covers only reductions in the item’s price. We compare what the customer originally paid with the current price for the identical SKU—nothing more. If a customer simply forgot to apply a promo code, that is not a price-match case and should be handled under the standard guidelines. No senior or supervisory approval is required; however, if a situation falls outside these guidelines, please escalate it for further support or authorization. By default, refunds are back to the original payment method and may take up to 14 business days to reflect in the customer’s account, from the moment the refund is issued. If the original payment method is clearly unavailable (e.g., a closed account), note this in the Jira ticket and ask the Refund Team to issue the refund via IBAN instead. Inform the customer that they will receive an email requesting their IBAN details. STEP 1 - Check the order status Order not yet delivered First, verify the payment status. Then follow the appropriate price-match steps for Approved, Pending, or Rejected payments, as per below: Payment status What to tell the customer Actions Approved “Your payment has cleared. We can adjust the total to today’s lower price.” Request the price-match refund Rejected “The payment didn’t go through. Please try again with another payment method or contact your bank. Once the new order succeeds, we’ll match the lower price.” No price match until a successful payment.* Pending “Your payment is still processing. Let’s wait up to 24 hours. I’ll follow up then.” Re-check in 24 hours: If approved → treat as Approved . If declined → treat as Rejected . *If an order is initially rejected—say, because the payment fails and the order is cancelled—but the customer later manages to complete the purchase, you may honor the lower price shown on their first attempt once the new payment is confirmed. Ask the customer to place the new order at the current price, then contact back so we can refund the difference. Order already delivered Confirm whether the item is still inside the trial period Within the window: request a refund to the price-match. Outside the window: explain that the eligibility period has passed and a price match is no longer possible. STEP 2 - Request the refund Click the steps below 1. Jira Ticket Open a JIRA ticket * trough this portal. ​ *BE ; NL ; DE and AT : For these supporting markets with Jira integrated in Sprinklr, the refunds should be requested through Sprinklr. Email subject line: Price‑Match Request Emma Online (D2C) – Price‑Match Request Bestseller eCommerce – Price‑Match Request ​ NL Market Only: Email subject line : [Retailer Name] – Price‑Match Request Reason for refund: Discounts - Price Match 2. Price check and screenshots You will do a price check*: Open Fluent and your customer's respective country's Emma website to check both prices (original price and current price). Take one screenshot of the price paid by the customer on the original order, visible on Fluent, and the current discounted price, by checking on the Website. Take screenshot(s) that shows the following: Original price – the amount paid as displayed in Fluent. Current price – the new promotional price obtained by you simulating* the order on our website. Note: *When you run the price check, select the exact same SKU, size, colour, and region . Ensure each of those details is clearly visible in the screenshot. This image is the proof the Refund Team needs to approve the adjustment without delay or rejection. ​ Example: Fluent screenshot Website screeshot Note: For a second price-match on the same item, it’s refund value will be the difference between the first price drop’s (in practice, the second price the item had) and second price drop (in practice, the third price the item had). See an example below ​ How to calcute the refund sum: Example of multiple price-match requests for the same product Same SKU, within the 100-day (or your market's equivalent) trial period: Original price - 600€ 1st price drop - 550€ | Price-match refund: 50€ (original price 600€ - 1st price drop 550€) 2nd price drop - 520€ | 2nd Price match refund: 30€ (1st price drop 550€ - 2nd price drop 520€) For more details on refund check : How to: Refunds & Credit Memo ​ ​ Market Specific Guidelines UK & IE - If the customer is requesting a price- match against a give-away/bundles/pack item eg: The mattress now comes with a pillow for examples, please escalate to a senior/supervisor for a 10% promo-code. DE,BE,AT,PT & ES - If the customer is requesting a price- match against a give-away/bundles/pack item eg: The mattress now comes with a pillow for examples, please escalate internally for a final decision. NL - Price matching is available for e‑commerce retailers; please include the retailer’s name in the subject line of the refund request. If a customer requests a price match against a giveaway, bundle, or pack item (e.g., a mattress that now comes with a free pillow), please escalate the case internally for a final decision.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/refund,Mon Nov 17 15:17:40 UTC 2025

Customer Inquiry,WIMO,Parcel delivered to Parcel Shop,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Delivery to Parcel shop What is a Parcel shop? Why and when is a parcel delivery to a Parcel shop? How is the customer informed? Deliver parcel from parcel shop to customer's address Parcel delivered in Parcel station / Parcel locker Delivery to Parcel shop This article is to clarify what a parcel shop is, when is the parcels delivered to a parcel shop, and how the customer is informed. What is a Parcel shop? A parcel shop is a store, gas station, or similar where the carrier can deliver parcels for the customers to pick up whenever it fits them. It is always marked on the store which carriers they collaborate with as in the picture below for a GLS parcel shop. Why and when is a parcel delivery to a Parcel shop? Normally a parcel is delivered to a parcel shop when the carrier has tried to deliver the parcel to the customer's address and the customer was unavailable or not home. The carrier does not wait outside the customer's house and we cannot expect the carrier to call the customer when arriving to the customer's address. If the customer was unavailable for the delivery the carrier will sometimes deliver the parcel to a parcel shop near the customer's address. We cannot guaranty the customer that the parcel will be delivered to a parcel shop if the customer is not home when the carrier tries to deliver the parcel. If the tracking says it was delivered in a parcel shop then that is the case If the tracking does not say delivered in parcel shop and the tracking does not say returned to sender, then the carrier will try and deliver the parcel to the customer's address again one of the next working days, The customer can go to the parcel shop in it's opening hours, which they can find on google, to pick up the parcel. How is the customer informed? The customer will receive a notification either via SMS or email directly from the carrier. In this notification, the customer will find the tracking number, address of the parcel shop and other necessary information the customer needs to pickup the parcel. Deliver parcel from parcel shop to customer's address It is not possible for the carrier to pick up the parcel again once it has been delivered in the parcel shop. This is because the parcel is already marked as delivered in our and the carrier's system. It is therefore not possible for us or the carrier to redeliver the parcel. Parcel delivered in Parcel station / Parcel locker When a parcel is delivered to a parcel station or parcel locker, it means the same as when delivered to a parcel shop. The difference between these locations is: Parcel shop = store Parcel station / parcel locker = no human service provided Notification differences: Parcel shop = notification via SMS or email Parcel station/parcel locker = notification via SMS, email, or psychical note in customer's mailbox. No matter the type of notification, the customer will always receive the notification from the carrier directly and it will contain all the necessary information to pick up the parcel. Parcel shop. The customer gets the parcel with the help of a human. Parcel station / parcel locker. The customer gets a code in the notification from the carrier , goes to the station/locker, types the provided code, and the ""door"" will open and the customer can collect their parcel.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/wmo,Thu Oct 30 11:20:41 UTC 2025
Customer Inquiry,WIMO,WIMO - Delivery is Delay,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction The journey of an item: Unhappy Path Delivery is delay Why the order is delayed? Order Stuck Order Out of Stock Warehouse and Last Mile Delays Unable to Deliver Introduction In this article, you will learn what to do when items are out of the promised delivery date, and consequently, the order is delayed. Whenever you face a delayed order, you are responsible for providing clear information to the customer about the status of the order and what will happen next In order to do that, you must follow investigation steps to identify what is the root cause of the delay and manage the customer expectations regarding the solution and delivery time. Review: Make sure to also read all the related WIMO articles, such as WIMO - What is it? and WIMO - Delivery is On Time . The journey of an item: Unhappy Path As explained in the article What is WIMO , we have different phases that the item goes through after it's purchased and before arriving to the customer. During this journey, unexpected issues can happen that could cause a delayed delivery. Delivery is delay We will always try our best to minimize the negative impact of the delay and appreciate the customer for choosing Emma. If information is available about the delay, give an explanation, and be transparent with the customer. Always show a willingness to help and to ensure the customer receives their item at the earliest convenience. The image below shows with blue dots the phases in which we can face problems and the arrows indicate which can be the issue: Order Stuck: Problems with the transmission of the order like address errors, payment issues, or system bugs. Order Out of Stock: The item is out of stock and the order has yet not be fulfilled. Or is delayed, but already fulfilled. Warehouse delays: Order dispatched with delay by the warehouse. Last mile delays: These happen with unable-to-delivery scenarios or due to Logistic Claims (parcel lost, partial delivery, etc). Why the order is delayed? Step 1: Investigate the order in detail After being contacted by a customer asking about their order, you will have to open the order in the case and look at the details of it to understand what exactly is happening. It's possible that only one item was not delivered, or that we are having an issue at the warehouse. So, before determining the reason and taking further action, please check carefully the order in the system. Check the ""Promised delivery date"": expire within 2 days or it is already in the past? Check the ""Fulfilment status"" of all items of the order Item by item identification: which status is each item at?

In order to do that, you must first investigate the case to clarify what is the reason for the delay and manage customer expectations about the outcome and the expected arrival of their item. Identifying the reason is necessary as based on that you will know exactly how to handle to support the customer. We have 4 different scenarios that can cause a delivery to be delayed and each one of them has distinct resolutions. Let's check in detail each one of them: Order Stuck The Order is Stuck when is not being transmitted in the system, normally due to a Payment Issue , Address typo , or System bug . Those cases happen between the phases ""Purchase"" and ""Order Confirmed"" and when the Order Status is at Unknown or the status is for more than 05 days stuck in one of the following: For Magento: Packing; Prepared for Export. For FluentCommerce: Assigned; How to work on it? Check OMS (Order Management System); Identify that the order status is unknown; Open a ticket to Back-Office team (for Central Europe countries) or to OM team (for all other countries) informing them the status is stuck and asking them to review the order; When the team responsible gets back to you, you check the delivery date update and send it via email to the customer. ​ Order Out of Stock We may face situations where the product purchased by a customer is facing an out-of-stock situation. For those cases, the order will not go to ""Order Confirmed"" and will neither be ""Submitted to Warehouse"". The Fulfillment or Barcode status will show as "" Waiting on Stock"" . ​ How to work on it? Check OMS (Order Management System) Identify that the status is ""Waiting on Stock""; Check if there's an Updated Delivery Date and follow the instructions . Warehouse and Last Mile Delays ​ After the Order is Confirmed it will be ""Submitted to Warehouse"" and later will be ""Dispatched"", since the carrier will pick-up the item to make a delivery. Those are the Fulfillment/Barcode status that you may see: For Magento: Order submitted to warehouse Order received by warehouse Waiting for Delivery date Parcel data submitted / ready for shipping Arrived at sorting center Out for deliver For FluentCommerce: Submitted to FL Received by FL Picked & Packed by FL Ready to Dispatch Dispatched Arrived at the sorting center Out for delivery ​ How to work on it? Check OMS (Order Management System); Identify which is the status (if order with Warehouse or with order with carrier); Check the Last Mile delivery times article and the Excel sheet there; The file gives an estimation time of how long an order stays with the warehouse and how long stays with the carrier based on the SKU of the item; After checking those dates, please use the Canned Responses of WIMO (number XX) to inform the customer accordingly about the delivery date. Unable to Deliver ​ IMPORTANT : Once the order is at the hands of the Carrier we still may face some situations in which the delivery is not successful.

Customer Inquiry,WIMO,WIMO - Delivery is On Time,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Order is under promised delivery time Order on time: but will be delayed How to identify that the order will be delayed? How to escalate? How to manage customer expectations? Introduction After understanding What is WIMO and how to identify the Order Status, in this article you will learn what to do when the order of the customer is under a Happy Path and the Delivery is On Time. Additionally, we will see how to identify if the order can potentially be delayed and how to act on it. Order is under promised delivery time First, let's recap how to identify if the Order Status is going as expected: -> Access the related Order Management System (Fluent Commerce or Magento) and: Identify the promised delivery date Check order status Check all items (fulfillment) status If already under the status ""Shipped"" , check the delivery tracking link -> if no tracking link, access the delivery partner portal and check the delivery status. Now, after checking all the information, you confirmed that the order is shipped and in the hands of the delivery company and is estimated to arrive within the promised delivery date. GOOD NEWS! This means the order is on time! The final step is replying to the customer: Make sure to provide accurate information regarding the delivery of the order and educate the customer where to track the information by themselves in the future. Order on time: but will be delayed Preventing issues: it's necessary for us as well to take a look carefully at the promised delivery date and be able to identify if indeed the order will arrive, or if not, and then we can anticipate an issue and act on it to reduce customer dissatisfaction. How to identify that the order will be delayed? You checked the information in the Order Management system and the items ordered by the customer are showing still under the promised delivery date. But, you may face 2 situations that need to be looked into in detail because it means that the order will be delayed : 1) The item is not under ""Shipped"" status and it's less than 2 days from the expected delivery time: If promised delivery date will expire in the upcoming 2 days and barcode status shows the item has not been shipped: Escalate the case. 2) The delivery date is under the expected time, however, the Barcode/Fulfillment status is showing ""Out of Stock"": If available for your market, access the country-related Out of stock replenishment plan information that shows the prediction of item in the warehouse, and delivery expectations. If not available for your market the replenishment plan, please Escalate the case following the instructions below. -> How to escalate? The escalation means that another team needs to work on the case to understand the problem and take actions to guarantee the order can be delivered, or at least to provide a new delivery time. Escalation for Central Europe countries: JIRA ticket via CECE Portal Escalation for remaining markets: JIRA ticket via the Order Management Portal -> How to manage customer expectations? Manage customer expectations regarding the escalation process: The teams will give you an answer in the upcoming 24 hours; and for the customer, you inform that an answer will be provided within 48 hours.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/wmo,Mon Nov 17 14:25:54 UTC 2025
Customer Inquiry,WIMO,WIMO - Unable to Deliver,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Why the order was not delivered successfully? How to solve Unable to Deliver issues? Address Issue No answer from customer Lost Parcel Rejected Parcel Introduction As mentioned in the article WIMO - Deliver is Delay , after the Carrier has the items of the customer's order some circumstances can cause the delivery to be completed successfully. In that stage, as it's the Last Mile moment, we consider those Delay issues under Unable to Deliver. In this article, we will see what causes an order to not be delivered correctly and what actions you can take accordingly. Why the order was not delivered successfully? A few situations can happen upon delivery that can result in the product(s) not being received by the customers. Those are the 4 reasons of Unable to Delivery scenarios: Address issue; No answer from customer; Lost Parcel; Rejected parcel (due to delay; or advised by CS (late cancellation); or Parcel damaged). How to solve Unable to Deliver issues? Address Issue This may happen due to the customer's address being incomplete or incorrect, resulting in the carrier company not being able to find the location and complete the delivery. In those cases: If it's a 1MH carrier (accessories and mattresses <20kg), they will inform the customer via email that it wasn’t possible to deliver the order. If this happens, they are going to send the order to the nearest parcel shop (information is sent by email or SMS). If the customer doesn't pick up in a specific period, then the item is going to be returned to sender. If it's a 2MH carrier (beds and mattresses >20kg), the carrier always tries to contact the customer directly via phone number and email in order to solve the issue and finish the delivery, or re-scheduling a new date. If no feedback from the customer, proceed as follows: The carrier will email the CS team to report the address issue; CS agent tries to contact de customer to ask for the complete address; (Canned Responses B4.1) CS agent need to send a reply maximum in the next 72h or delivery will be canceled: If we have information from customer, CS agent replies to carrier email with the new address; If no reply from customer, CS agents reply to the carrier informing no info and asking them to cancel the shipment and to return the items. Once the Order appears with the shipment as canceled on the system, CS agent can proceed with the refund to customer. ​ No answer from customer In this scenario we have an unresponsive customer, that is not answering the door and/or neither the phone. This can happen due to carriers not having the correct phone number of the customer; or if the customer is indeed not at the location to receive the delivery. In those cases, the carrier always tries to contact the customer directly via phone number and email first, but in case of no answer from them, please proceed as follows: The carrier will email the CS team to report the customer does not respond to the carrier's attempt to deliver (no answer from the door or phone); CS agent tries to contact de customer to ask for contact information/ to be attentive to the delivery (Canned Responses B4.3) CS agent needs to send a reply maximum in the next 72 hours or delivery will be canceled: -> If we have information from the customer, CS agent replies to the carrier email with the new contact info; -> If no reply from the customer, CS agent replies to the carrier informing no info and asking them to cancel the shipment and to return the items. Once the Order appears with the shipment as canceled on the system, CS agent can proceed with the refund to customer. ​ Lost Parcel The Lost Parcel cases are for if the order is not delivered completed. Here we have 2 different possibilities of who informed the loss and we also have 2 different ways of handling it: 1) Carrier informed about Lost Parcel: In those cases, the carrier probably lost the item between hubs and inform us immediately. -> How to handle: The carrier will email the CS team to report the issue and to confirm in the email that the loss is their responsibility; CS agent needs to create a Logistic Claim, attach the carrier's emails, and then inform customer via email about the situation (Canned Responses B5.1) CS agent creates a Supplement Order and send email to the Carrier - maximum in the next 48h - informing about the new order and the item number Carrier will hold the order until the supplement item arrives at the hub and then make the delivery completely to the customer; Once the system indicates a new delivery date, CS agent can inform the customer via email about it (Canned Responses B5.2) 2 ) Customer informed about Lost Parcel: Here, it is the customer who contacted us to report their order was not delivered in full. They can have noticed during delivery but not able to resolve with the carrier; or they only noticed during assembly and decided to contact us. How to handle: The first step is to email back the customer apologizing for the situation and explaining that we will investigate the case (Canned Response B4.4) Then, the procedures of Logistic Claims and Lost in Transit must be followed accordingly in order to check proof of delivery from the carrier or to request binding documentation from the customer. Please refer to the article to handle the case correctly. Depending on how the case evolves, you need to keep the customer informed via email. For this please use the appropriate Canned Responses from B4.5 onwards. ​ Rejected Parcel Due to delay: This can happen when a customer is unhappy with a significant delay in the delivery date, but didn't inform us in advance and upon arrival decides to reject the delivery. (Ticket categorization: Cancellation >> Cancellation Due to Delay) ​ -> How to handle: The carrier will report the cancellation of the shipment via email to the CS team. The agent needs to open a ticket to Refund team to ask for the customer to be reimbursed. DO NOT open a return request. ​ Advised by CS (late cancellation): Usually, this will happen in cases in which the customer could not cancel due to the order being too far in the process, and it was instructed to reject the delivery. (FD ticket categorization: Cancellation >> Reject Delivery) ​ -> How to handle: The carrier will change status of the fulfillment to ""return to sender complete"". The agent needs to open a ticket to Refund team to ask for the customer to be reimbursed. DO NOT open a return request .

Understanding the journey of an item The Happy Path journey The Unhappy Path journey Identifying the Order Status How to identify the order status? In FluentCommerce In Magento Tracking link issues Website Self-Service: Order Status Bar How to do the WIMO Freshdesk Ticket categorization? Introduction About 80% of all Emma orders are delivered on time. We globally dispatch various trucks loaded with products every day. The remaining 20% of orders might incur delays due to various reasons, such as production or logistic capacity, unforeseen events impacting infrastructure or resource availability, and system issues. However, the delays are the top driver reasons for the most negative experience for our customers. Due to that, this article supports you in identifying what is happening with the customer order, what to do next, and how to correctly and empathetically reply to our customers in case they reach out to you asking: ""Where Is My Order? "" Why do customers contact us? In WIMO inquiries, we should always understand if it is a Happy or Unhappy path scenario, both we will see in detail further down in this article. The first step is to identify the contact reason, which will determine the actions and processes that you will have to follow. So, the customers can reach out to us asking ""Where is my order?"" in 2 different scenarios: 1) Everything is fine with the order, delivery is on time & customer needs additional information -> Happy Path. Order is on time, and everything flows as expected, but somehow customer can not follow the order path or just need a confirmation of the delivery date. Here, the customer experience is crucial as they need our support for guidance and indication of the next steps, since there is a lack of visibility from customer side about the order. 2) There is an issue with the order & customer wants information and a solution -> Unhappy Path . When something went wrong with the order, and a resolution is needed. In this scenario, the service is out of our standards and caused the order to be delayed. contacts The customer has no visibility of what will happen next, and contacts us looking for clarification and a proper solution. Understanding the journey of an item Once completing the purchase on our website, we want to ensure all communication is properly set and the customer has a seamless experience with us, with the right expectations set and the item arriving under the promised delivery time. Ideally, with all this in place, the customer should not need to contact our customer support. Review: For more details, please read the articles focused on the the orders journey for Magento and also for FluentCommerce . The Happy Path journey Under a Happy Path, even if the order is flowing properly in our supply chain, we may receive contact to have a better visibility of some stage that somehow customer is lacking. For example, the customer had an email issue or the tracking link was not working properly. The Unhappy Path journey Although, for an Unhappy Path, we have different phases of the process we can face an unexpected challenge, that could lead to a delayed order, and consequently a possible customer inquiry. In the image below, the blue dots highlight the moment of the journey in which those problems can happen. Issues between steps 1 and 2 ( between order submitted and order confirmed), we may face some scenarios such as: Order Stuck : Problems with the transmission of the order like address errors, payment issues or system bugs. Order Out of Stock: The item Item is out of stock and the order has yet not fulfilled. Or is delayed, but already fulfilled Issues between steps 2 and 3: Once in the hands of warehouse partners, we can face an unexpected delay by their side, preventing the order from being dispatched under the expected time. Warehouse delays: Order dispatched with delay by the warehouse. Issues between steps 4 and 5: Some occurrences during the delivery of the order, once in the hands of the last mile company, may also influence the delivery time; such as a logistic claim, or an unable-to-deliver scenario (no answer from the customer, or wrong address provided). Last mile delays : These happen with unable-to-delivery scenarios or due to Logistic Claims (parcel lost, partial delivery, etc). Identifying the Order Status Now it's the moment to identify if the order and respective items are under expected delivery time and will be delivered on time, or if there is an issue going on and the order will be delayed . How to identify the order status? Access the related Order Management System (Fluent Commerce or Magento) and: Identify the promised delivery date Check order status Check all items (fulfillment) status If already shipped, check the delivery tracking link -> if no tracking link, access the delivery partner portal and check the delivery status In FluentCommerce -> Click on the link here and then under the bottom ""Guide me"" to have these steps in a side window that will guide you while navigating in FluentCommerce: HERE In Magento -> Click on the link here and then under the bottom ""Guide me"" to have these steps in a side window that will guide you while navigating in Magento: HERE For Magento ONLY: Currently, in certain cases in Magento is possible to see updated messages regarding the delivery date. When these messages appear, it's an indication that the delivery was delayed, the system identified and corrected to the new dates. Also, the customer is informed about it via e-mail. This is how it will look in the system: How to read the Delivery Sign: 1. "" Previous updated delivery date -> This means what the customer has been informed about from outside, so you have a history of automated communication related to delivery time updates. 2. "" Promised Delivery Date "" -> This was the date shown to the customer when they ordered. If today is still within this range , it means the order is not delayed ! 3. "" Updated Delivery Date "" -> This means a new delivery date due to delays. This information is visible to the customer. Tracking link issues When investigating where is the order of the customer, you should always access the order-related carrier portal to track the order. In case there was any issue during the delivery, such as the customer being unreachable during the delivery, or a delay during the dispatch, you will be able to find this information on the carrier portal and properly manage the customer expectations. You can find the tracking link under the Order details, purchase orders section in the Order Management tool: You can find the carrier portal knowledge article HERE . When checking the status, please take into consideration the time-frame for the delivery to be completed: If by the moment the customer contacts us, the delivery date to less than 1 week : Order is on its way! If by the moment the customer contacts us, the delivery date for more than 10 days : Order can be delayed > 1 Week for delivery: reach out to the delivery company and ask for further information. Website Self-Service: Order Status Bar The order status bar is a customer-facing section on the website, that displays the status of each barcode within a given order number. The customer can access the status bar by clicking on the link on the homepage ( https://www.emma-matratze.de/bestellstatus/ ) and inserting the order number and associated email address The information contains Order status Barcode status Parcel Perform status WIMO (where is my order) Dates, also called ""updated delivery dates"" What does it look like? How to do the WIMO Freshdesk Ticket categorization? One important step regarding WIMO tickets is to correctly categorize it in Freshdesk, so we can keep data updated and accurate regarding delivery issues. Customer Inquiries for Where is My Order? can be listed as: Categorization: WIMO -> Delivery Still on Time Categorization: WIMO -> Delivery Delay Freshde sk Ticket Accuracy Ensure you always provide the related Ticket type & subtype based on the customer request , according to what is indicated in the article ""Freshdesk - Ticket categorization list"" Make sure to consider the Promised delivery date, if one business day has passed since the promised date we should use the categorization ""WIMO -> Delivery Delay"".",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/customer-inquiry/wmo,Fri Nov 14 08:35:24 UTC 2025

GDPR & Legal,Data Breash,Data Breach: What is it & best practices,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction What is a Data Breach? Best practices to avoid data breaches and data security issues Examples of data breaches and prevention measures Introduction At Emma, the security of customer data and sensitive information is of utmost importance. As our customer support, you play a crucial role in identifying and reporting potential security incidents, data breaches, and phishing emails. This article explains what is a data breach and best practices to avoid it from happening. What is a data breach? This is not the same as a DSR or a GDPR request. A data breach is an incident where confidential, sensitive, or protected information is accessed, disclosed, or used by an unauthorized person or entity . This can happen due to various reasons such as human error, cyber-attacks, or system vulnerabilities. Best practices to avoid data breaches and data security issues Verify Customer Identity: Always follow Emma’s guidelines to verify the customer’s identity. Data Minimization: Only collect and use the data necessary to fulfill the customer’s request. No CC or BCC: Agents are not allowed to use the CC (carbon copy) or BCC (blind carbon copy) fields when sending emails to customers. All communications should be directed to a single recipient at a time. Confidentiality: Treat all customer information as confidential. Do not disclose any customer information to unauthorized parties ( REMEMBER : family and friends are unauthorized parties unless the customer provides consent to share the data with them!). Accurate Information: Double-check all information before sending to ensure that it pertains to the correct customer. Attachments: Ensure any attachments are meant for the intended recipient and are free from viruses or malware. Order Confirmation: Verify the order details and customer information before sending a confirmation email. Examples of data breaches and prevention measures Misaddressed Email: An agent sends an order confirmation to the wrong customer, revealing order details and personal information. Prevention: Verify the recipient’s email address and order details before sending. Implement a system of checks to catch mismatches. Incorrect Attachment: An agent attaches a file containing another customer’s order history to an email. Prevention: Verify attachments before sending. Ensure the file name and contents match the intended customer’s information. Unauthorized Access by Former Employees: A former employee still has access to the email system and customer information, which they use maliciously. Prevention: Immediately revoke access to all systems and data upon employee termination. Regularly audit access logs to ensure only authorized personnel have access. Data Entry Error: An agent mistakenly enters another customer’s information into a customer’s account, leading to a mix-up of orders and personal details. Prevention: Implement double-checking procedures for data entry.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/gdpr-legal/data-breach,Mon Oct 27 10:11:43 UTC 2025

How to handle a phishing e-mail Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any requested information; Report : If you receive a ticket related to phishing emails and happen to click on it, you should immediately report it to your supervisor. Your supervisor should urgently report it to the Emma IT team; Delete: Delete the phishing email from your inbox; Monitor: Keep an eye on your accounts for any unusual activity and report it immediately.

GDPR & Legal,Overview,Security Protocol: Customer Identification,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Identification factors How do we identify the customer? Call recording Third-party verification Third-party verification - Death/Bereavement Identification factors For any customer contact (phone, email, and chat) in which the customer requests information on their Emma account, information or action on an existing order, we should never confirm the existence of the order or provide any information to the customer, concerning the order or the account, until the customer's identity has been verified. However, if the customer is contacting us via email and the email address being used is the same as the one used to place the order with us, then we can consider the customer automatically authenticated. Additionally, we can change this information in the Order Management System (Magento or FluentCommerce), but we need to make sure that we authenticated the customer first, using three additional factors, excluding the one we will be amending. So, for example, if the customer wants to change the email address connected to the order we must authenticate him/her first using three of the following five elements: name under which the order was placed, order number, delivery address or phone number. How do we identify the customer? ​ We must match 3 i dentification factors , before giving any information or acting on an existing order. ​ Those factors are important to verify the customer's identity before acting on their requests. This will avoid disclosing data to a party that is not entitled to it and also potential fraud. Name under which the order was placed (do not confuse this with the name under the billing or shipping addresses) Email address used to place the order Order number Delivery address Telephone number included in the billing address It is necessary to leave a note ( Yes / No / N/A ) in Magento for each customer contact if the identity has been verified: Yes : Identity successfully verified with at least 3 matching identification factors from the order. No : Identity could not be verified - could not proceed with the request. N/A : Identification was not necessary. Verification is not necessary for requests that do not relate to an order or a customer account. IMPORTANT: We should not ask a customer to provide us with any additional authentication factors after they have given us 3 valid ones. After this is done, if we continue to ask for more authentication factors, we are blocking the customer's access to information that they are at this point legally entitled to. Third-party verification ​ If a third party contacts us requesting information/action on an order that he/she did not place themselves, we may NOT give out any info in the first instance. IMPORTANT If police officers or lawyers contact us regarding an order or a customer account, information is not allowed to be provided on the phone or via chat. Phone Contact: We ask third parties to put the person who placed the order on the phone, verify his/her identity, and proactively ask for their authorisation to talk about the order with the third party. If the customer is not there, they must contact us themselves by email or by phone at a later time to request the information in question. Alternatively, during the phone call, we can send an email to the email address that the customer left in their order without providing said email address to the person contacting us on the phone. Chat Contact: If the person contacting us identifies himself/herself as the customer that placed the order and correctly provides 3 identification factors, we proceed with the contact. However, if the person contacting us via chat identifies himself/herself as someone else, we then have two alternatives. Either that person provides a written authorization letter (CE_Authorization Letter, file attached to this article) signed by the customer that placed the order, allowing us to talk and disclose information to the current requester (wife, son, friend, etc) or we ask to be contacted using the email address that was used to place the order (which will bypass any need for further authentication. Email Contact: If the contact is coming from the email address that was used to place the order on OMS, even if it is signed by someone else, we can proceed and do not require further authentication. However, i f the person is contacting us using a different email address than the one that was used to place the order, the agents should ask the customer to contact us using the email address that was used to place the order and tell the customer that, if that is no longer possible, they should provide us their name (as present in the order), the order number and the email address used to place the order, so that we are able to assist further. Third-party verification in cases of death/bereavement For verification purposes, in cases of bereavement the person contacting only needs to provide the 3 authentication factors, following the same process as if it was the customer contacting us (No relationship documentation is needed). However in case changes are requested, e.g.: customer wants to have the receipt sent to another email. We will require the customer to provide a death certificate for the person that originally placed the order. Again no relationship document is needed. Once you have received a valid death certificate you can proceed with the change requested and afterwards the document (death certificate) will need to be deleted. Death certificate is needed only for due diligence and is deleted as soon as possible. docx Authorization letter.docx 0.01 MB",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/gdpr-legal/overview,Fri Nov 14 16:24:42 UTC 2025

Freshdesk Skill Naming Convention How To's - Ticket Assignment Guide for Supervisors and CE Managers How to add new agents to skills (if you do not have the proper access please contact IT): How to toggle Agent Availability Skill Mapping per Market Load-balanced ticket assignment - Omniroute What is Automatic Ticket Assignment? For each Freshdesk group, we can configure the distribution and balance the number of tickets assigned to agents within the Group. To enable or modify this for your market please submit a ticket to the IT Portal . Round Robin ticket assignment - Assign tickets to agents in a circular order (no special logic) Load balanced ticket assignment - Tickets are assigned based on an agent's load. Configure agent load under Omniroute ™ settings . Omniroute settings can be directly configured by Supervisors. Skill based ticket assignment - Assign tickets to agents based on their skills (see ""What are Skills?"" below). When a skill is mapped to two or more agents, incoming tickets will be assigned to the agent with a lesser load. Only IT or CE Global team should create Skills. Please log a ticket if needed. Manual (not recommended) - automatic ticket assignment is turned off. Either agents pick from the queue or supervisors assign tickets manually. What is Agent Availability? Agent Availability determines whether or not the agent is available to be assigned tickets. To enable or modify this for your market please submit a ticket to the IT Portal . Allow agents to control their availability status - Agents can choose to go offline for automatic ticket assignment. Allow only admins/supervisors to control agents’ availability status - Only supervisors can change agents' status using the availability dashboard. What are Skills? Skills allow you to easily match tickets to the right agents. You can associate distinct skills to each agent and create rules to make sure that only tickets matching those skills are assigned to them. If the skill mapped to a ticket matches an agent's skill, the ticket will be assigned to the agent. The market can choose to rearrange the Skills depending on priority. Some agents can be assigned more than one skill. Whichever skill is first in order would be prioritized for the agents. The load is computed at a group level i.e. even if the agent is a part of multiple groups, the load that you have set under the Skill-based assignment checks only for the open tickets in that group. Sample (from FR group): The Marketplaces skill is first in order so if Agent A is in both Marketplaces and Post Delivery skills, the agent will be assigned Marketplaces tickets first. Skill sample: FR - Pre Delivery Skill conditions must be existing ticket fields (cannot be Tags, Requester email addresses, or words in the Subject). To enable or modify this for your market please submit a ticket to the IT Portal . Freshdesk Skill Naming Convention Skills should use the following convention: General Skills (main skill for assignment, no specialties) - <Freshdesk Group> - General For one group with specialty: <Freshdesk Grou p> - <Specialty> For multiple groups: <Grou p1><Group2 > - <Specialty> How To's - Ticket Assignment Guide for Supervisors and CE Managers As agreed with BPO Management team, BPO Supervisors are responsible for adding/removing agents to/from Skills. How to add new agents to skills (if you do not have the proper access please contact IT): Go to this link and look for the skill for your market (see table below or refer to this file ). Click on Manage : Click on Add Agent then add as many agents as needed. Click on Done , then Save . How to toggle Agent Availability If you are an agent : Check the upper right corner of your Freshdesk Tickets page: Helpdesk : Bettzeit GmbH (freshdesk.com) . If you are unable to see this icon, this means you are not assigned to a group that is using Automatic Ticket Assig The moon icon indicates that the agent is Unavailable: Click on the icon to toggle agent availability as needed.

Management KB,Sprinklr,Offline Supervisor's Guide: Reporting Sprinklr Issues,"TABLE OF CONTENTS ​ Why Structured Reporting Matters How to Report Issues the Right Way A. Summary – Clear & Specific Title B. Category – Choose the Right Type C. Steps to Reproduce – Show the Problem, Step by Step D. Business Impact – Why Does This Matter? E. Attachments – Show, Don’t Just Tell F. Suggested Fix (If Applicable – Optional for Feature Requests) The Impact of Better Issue Reporting Final Checklist Before Submitting an Issue Correct vs. Incorrect Issue Reporting Guide ❌ Incorrect Example ✅ Correct Example ​ A well-structured reporting guideline is essential for clear and effective communication of issues, enabling faster resolutions and optimizing workflow efficiency. This SOP establishes a standardized approach to issue tracking and resolution, ensuring consistency and improved outcomes. Following these best practices will result in a more effective workflow. ​ Why Structured Reporting Matters ✅ Faster Fixes – When devs have complete information, they can start working without delays. ✅ Better Prioritization – Real business impact determines what gets fixed first, not just ""High Priority"" labels. ✅ Less Manual Work – No need for the project lead to filter or rewrite reports. ✅ Accurate Categorization – Bugs, enhancements, and performance issues require different solutions. Right now, reports go through unnecessary extra steps before reaching devs. By improving reporting, we reduce the workload on everyone and speed up issue resolution. ​ How to Report Issues the Right Way A. Summary – Clear & Specific Title 🚫 Wrong: “Ticket assignment not working properly.” ✅ Right: “Key Account Tickets Not Auto-Assigned to Senior Agents – Requires Manual Supervisor Intervention” Why? A vague title requires more questions. A clear, specific title instantly describes the issue and who is affected. B. Category – Choose the Right Type This ensures the issue is sent to the right team: Bug = Something that was working before but is now broken. Enhancement = A missing feature that should exist to support business needs. Performance Issue = The system is slow, unresponsive, or causing workflow delays. Data Issue = Incorrect, missing, or duplicated information. For this example: ✅ Enhancement – Auto-assignment functionality is missing but should be available to streamline operations. Enhancements can be urgent if backed by a business case. C. Steps to Reproduce – Show the Problem, Step by Step 🚫 Wrong: ""Supervisors are manually assigning cases. Can we automate it?"" ✅ Right: A Key Account customer submits a case in Sprinklr CRM . Instead of automatically routing to the assigned Senior Agent , the case goes into the general queue. A Supervisor has to manually reassign the ticket to the correct Senior Agent. If the assigned agent is on leave or unavailable , there is no clear backup, causing delays. Expected Behavior: Cases from Key Accounts should be automatically assigned to their assigned Senior Agent in their LOB. If the Senior Agent is out , the case should fall back to another Senior Agent or a Supervisor for reassignment. Actual Behavior: No auto-assignment happens. Supervisors have to manually distribute cases, causing delays. No fallback logic exists for handling agent absences. Why? Without clear steps, developers can’t replicate the issue, making it impossible to fix. D. Business Impact – Why Does This Matter? Every issue can’t be High Priority unless justified. Use real-world impact to determine urgency. 🚫 Wrong: ""This is urgent, we need it fixed now!"" ✅ Right: ✔ Delays Work – Supervisors must manually assign every Key Account case , increasing their workload. ✔ Work Stoppage – If a Supervisor doesn’t assign a case quickly, customer response times suffer , impacting SLA compliance. ✔ Business-Critical – A lack of automated assignment means high-value accounts aren’t handled efficiently , risking customer dissatisfaction. Why? Just labeling an issue as high priority doesn’t explain its urgency. A strong business case helps ensure it gets fixed faster. E. Attachments – Show, Don’t Just Tell 🚫 Wrong: No screenshot or example provided. ✅ Right: Screenshots of how Key Account cases currently appear in the general queue. Screen recording of a Supervisor manually assigning a case. Example of an error log or workflow rule settings (if available). Why? A clear visual reference helps developers diagnose the issue faster. F. Suggested Fix (If Applicable – Optional for Feature Requests) If you have an idea for how this should work, include it. ✅ Right: “Add a rule that automatically assigns Key Account cases to Senior Agents based on predefined logic. If the assigned Senior Agent is unavailable, route the case to the Supervisor for reassignment.” The Impact of Better Issue Reporting By following this process, we achieve: Faster response times – No extra clarification needed. Better prioritization – Business-critical issues are handled first. Less frustration – BPOs, Supervisors, and Dev teams can work efficiently. More reliable system functionality – Problems are properly tracked and resolved. Final Checklist Before Submitting an Issue ​ ✅ Is the title clear and specific? (No vague “not working” reports) ✅ Did you select the correct category? (Bug, Enhancement, etc.) ✅ Are the steps to reproduce included? (Step-by-step breakdown) ✅ Did you explain the business impact? (Why does this matter?) ✅ Did you attach screenshots or recordings? (If applicable) Correct vs. Incorrect Issue Reporting Guide Scenario: Cases from Key Accounts are not automatically being assigned to Senior Case Agents. ​ ❌ Incorrect Example Title: ""Ticket assignment not working."" Issue Type: ✔ Bug (Incorrect selection) Agent Information: Role: Supervisor Date/Time: Left blank Number of Affected Users: Unknown Issue Details: Where in Platform? "" In the system. "" Steps to Reproduce: "" Key Account tickets are not going to the right agents. "" Expected Behavior: "" It should work automatically. "" Actual Behavior: "" We have to do it manually. "" Workaround Available?: "" Not sure. "" Business Impact: ☐ No Impact ☐ Delays Work ☐ Work Stoppage ☐ System Down (Not selected) Attachments: None attached. ​ ❌ Why is this incorrect? Title is too vague. Misclassified as a bug when it is actually an enhancement. Missing critical details (date/time, affected users, specific steps). No expected vs. actual behavior description. No workaround information. No business impact explanation to justify urgency. No attachments (screenshots, workflow examples, logs). ✅ Correct Example Title: ""Key Account Cases Not Auto-Assigning to Senior Agents – Requires Manual Supervisor Reassignment"" Issue Type: ✔ Enhancement Agent Information: Role: Supervisor Date/Time: 26/02/2025 – 10:30 UTC Number of Affected Users: Estimated 5+ Senior Agents across multiple LOBs Issue Details: Where in CRM? Sprinklr CRM > Ticket Routing Module Steps to Reproduce: A Key Account customer submits a case through Sprinklr CRM. Instead of automatically routing to the assigned Senior Agent , the case goes into the general queue. A Supervisor has to manually reassign the ticket to the correct Senior Agent. If the assigned agent is on leave or unavailable , there is no automatic fallback to another Senior Agent. Expected Behavior: Key Account cases should be auto-assigned to their designated Senior Agent. If the Senior Agent is unavailable (sick or on leave), the system should auto-reassign the case to another Senior Agent or the Supervisor for manual intervention. Actual Behavior: No auto-assignment exists. Supervisors must manually assign every case , causing delays. No fallback rule for unavailable agents , leading to unassigned or delayed cases. Workaround Available?: Supervisors must check and assign each ticket manually. If a Supervisor is unavailable, tickets remain unassigned until someone manually intervenes. Business Impact: ✔ Delays Work – Supervisors must manually assign every Key Account case , increasing their workload. ✔ Work Stoppage – If Supervisors don’t assign a case quickly, customer response times suffer , impacting SLA compliance. ✔ Business-Critical – A lack of automated assignment means high-value accounts aren’t handled efficiently , risking customer dissatisfaction. Attachments: ✅ Screenshot of a Key Account ticket sitting in the general queue instead of auto-routing. ✅ Screen recording of a Supervisor manually assigning cases one by one. ✅ Example of how routing logic works for standard cases but fails for Key Accounts . ​ ✅ Why is this correct? The title clearly states the problem and its impact. Correctly categorized as an enhancement instead of a bug. Includes detailed steps to reproduce the issue. Clearly outlines expected vs. actual behavior. Provides a valid business impact, justifying priority. Includes attachments to support the report.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/management-kb/sprinklr,Tue Nov 04 20:57:38 UTC 2025
Management KB,Sprinklr,Agent Capacity Configuration and Case Assignment,"Table of Content What is Agent Capacity? ​ Who Can Modify Agent Capacity? ​ Understanding the Capacity Configuration ​ Overcapacity Situations ​ Case Assignment ​ ​ -> Automatic Case Assignment ​ -> Manual Case Assignment ​ -> Checking Assignment Type What is Agent Capacity? Agent Capacity in Sprinklr defines how many cases an agent can handle at once across different channels. Each case type is assigned a weight, and agents have a total capacity of 100. The system automatically assigns cases based on this configuration. The standard Emma configuration is called “Emma Agent Capacity - General” . Who Can Modify Agent Capacity? Only the Sprinklr Team and Emma Tech Team are authorized to change agent capacity details. BPO personnel do not have access to these configurations. If you find an Agent without the Capacity set-up as per the image above, please raise a ticket to the Emma IT Team via the IT JIRA Portal . Understanding the Capacity Configuration The total agent capacity is set at 100. And each case type consumes part of this capacity based on its weight. Main Case Types and Weights: Voice Call – 100 Live Chat – 33 Social – 25 Email – 10 Live Chat Deflected – 33 Deflected to Email – 10 Overcapacity Situations Check the scenario in which overcapacity - capacity showing more than 100 - can happen: Deflection from Email to Chat: If a case starts as an Email (10 weight) and then deflects to Live Chat (33 weight), the agent's total capacity may exceed 100. If the total exceeds 100, the overflow function will not work. If deflection happens to a live channel, overflow also won’t work until the case is removed from the agent’s assignment. ​ Manual or Macro Assignment Over 100: If a case is manually assigned, assigned based on stickiness/preferred assignment (pending confirmation) or assigned via macro, it may push the agent’s capacity beyond 100. Case Assignment Automatic Case Assignment Sprinklr automatically assigns cases to agents based on capacity availability: Agents do not handle voice and chat simultaneously; Once an agent’s capacity reaches 100, no more cases will be automatically assigned; An overflow of one additional chat or voice case is allowed only if the agent's capacity is filled with offline cases (email or social); Cases only count as consumed capacity when assigned to an agent; Macros should be used to update case status and remove assignments when necessary, ensuring agents are not overloaded. Manual Case Assignment Cases can be manually assigned to an Agent. However, we don't instruct agents to do it unlesse authorized by the Supervisor. Those are the two ways to manually assign cases: Using the ""Assign to X"" Macro: Only for Supervisors to use. The Supervisor can apply the macro ""Assign to X"" and select to which agent the case will be assigned to. Clicking the “Assign to Me” button: Agents can only do it if authorized by the Supervisor. Checking Assignment Type To see how a case was assigned: Open the Queue Monotoring tab. Double-click on the agent’s “Detailed Consumed Capacity” . A side panel will open showing all assigned cases. The last assignment type will be listed at the bottom of each case panel: FAIR_ASSIGNMENT – Assigned via automatic fair routing. PREFERRED_ASSIGNMENT – Assigned based on preferred routing settings. MACRO – Assigned via macro action. MANUAL – Assigned manually by a user.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/management-kb/sprinklr,Fri Aug 29 02:08:10 UTC 2025

Management KB,Sprinklr,How to change Agents Skills Configuration,"This article provides instructions on how to modify Agents' Skills configuration. ​ ​ Table of Content ​ What is Agent Skills configuration? ​ How to check the Skill configuration per agent? ​ What is the expected Skill configuration per Line of Business? ​ When to make changes? ​ How to make changes on Skills configuration ​ ​ -> Changing Line of Business (Skills IDs) for Agents -> Changing Channels/Markets for Agents What is Agent Skills configuration? When a customer has a problem, they want to talk to someone who knows how to fix it. The Skills configuration is what makes sure that the customer's problem goes to the right agent. For this to happen, the Agent needs to have the right Skills set-up, and those skills are: market, language (if applicable), channel, line of business, BPO code. IMPORTANT: The Skills mentioned above are already configured when the user is onboarded at Emma and their account is created, based on the information provided by BPOs to the Emma IT team. How to check the Skill configuration per agent? 1) On the Supervisor Console, you need to open the ""Team Monitoring"" tab, and there you can check each agent. Next to the agent name, you have to click on the small black arrow that indicates ""Open details"" and then click on Properties"" in the right side menu. 2) After you open the Agent Properties, you have to check the following 4 fields: "" Skill IDs"" : indicates the Line of Business that the agents supports (i.e.: Support X Online Reputation X Offline, etc) "" User Channel Handling "": indicates which channel the agent supports (i.e.: Email X Voice X Chat, etc) "" Market "": indicates the market/country the agent supports, and it can be more than one if applicable. "" Voice direction "": If the agent supports Voice channel, this field it's irrelevant. However, for agents that support other channel and still have to make calls to customer, this field need to indicate ""Outbound"". Note: Don't worry if you see different information in other fields like ""Channel"" and ""Line of business"" . The only fields that will determine the case assignment are the ones indicated on the list above. What is the expected Skill configuration per Line of Business? ​ D2C Customer Support : “Skills Ids” required: Support and Sleep Experts “User Channel Handling” options: Email and/or Voice and/or Chat Market options: according to the market(s) supported D2C Online Reputation & HLE : “Skills Ids” required : Online Reputation and High Level Escalations “User Channel Handling” options: Social and Email Market options: according to the market(s) supported ""Voice Direction"" field: mandatory to indicate ""Outbound"". B2B (Wholesale) “Skills Ids” required: Offline and/ or Marketplaces “User Channel Handling” options: Email and/or Voice Market options: according to the market(s) supported O&O (Store) “Skills Ids” required: Store “User Channel Handling” options: Email and/or Voice (only for ES and PT that Voice is applicable) Market options: according to the market(s) supported ""Voice Direction"" field: mandatory to indicate ""Outbound"". Backoffice - N/A - don't use Disclaimer: In case of doubts regarding the correct channels to use per line of business, please reach out to your BPO account manager. When to make changes? Changes can be made for situations such as: - Agent moved to another team. Example: CS agent moved to Online Reputation team; or to Offline team. - Agent is temporarily giving support to another market or channel. Example: Voice only agent for FR is now supporting FR Email queue. ​ Once you make any change to the Agent Skills configuration, it means the agent will now have the criteria of another Queue and only receive the cases related to that Queue. How to make changes on Skills configuration: You will only need to make those changes if one agent will give support to a new/different working queue. The first step indicates how to change the Line of Business; and the second step shows how to modify the channel and/or market. -> Changing Line of Business (Skills IDs) for Agents: ​ Note: After 4th March, the only Skills visible to be changed on that option are: Emma Skills and BPOs . This is the expected behavior. If you need to change other criteria on the agent configuration, check the next part of this article. Please follow the instructions below: At the Supervisor Console, open the ""Team Monitoring"" option present on the left hand side menu; Select the necessary users; Click on the ""Edit/Add Skill""; On the new screen, select the skill category you want to change/edit and add it to the agent.

Onboarding,Customer Journey,The Customer Journey,"If you think about a recent experience you had with a brand, you’d likely think back to a specific moment, situation, or interaction you had between product research and post-purchase. This timeline is commonly referred to as the Customer Journey. What is Emma's customer journey? More specifically, every time Emma welcomes new customers, those customers go through a specific decision-making process. A customer journey is an entire experience a customer has while communicating with a brand. High-quality customer service is a crucial part of a successful customer journey. The more value we offer to potential clients, the more likely they are to complete the journey: It is about understanding how our customers behave and what they expect. Pre-Sales Stage The pre-sales phase includes all aspects of a customer’s interaction with Emma before a final purchase decision has been made. At this point of the journey, we count on a joint effort of the most diverse Teams. For example, Online and Offline marketing, and User experience. In this phase, customers are aware they have a need and are searching for possible solutions. Awareness: I want to sleep better! This is probably the first thought in the customer's head, before starting to become familiar with Emma. In most cases, they have a problem that our products will be able to solve. Here, the online and offline marketing teams play an important role, they create all the communication that will awaken customers' interest to know our brand. They portray the solutions to our customer's needs. In this way, the customer starts to become familiar with Emma including through channels such as social media, website, advertising campaigns, word-of-mouth, etc. Consideration: Should I get an Emma Mattress? The customer realizes that his need must be met and actively considers whether or not to buy our products. Other competitors can be also considered. Here, the customer tends to navigate our Social Media and especially on our websites. In this stage, the User Experience Team plays an important role in making information clear and easily available to boost customer consideration. Check below some typical touchpoints during this stage. To boost your knowledge and become a sleep expert, please check these categories: CS Sleep Experts Product Knowledge Base During this time, some customers tend to contact our customer support agents to understand more about the Emma 100 nights trial period, referral program, delivery time, discount codes, guarantees, product curiosities, payment details, and more. Pre-Delivery Stage The Pre-delivery stage covers all interactions customers have with Emma after completing the payment until the product arrives at their doorstep. Purchas e: Order completed with success! During this phase, the order confirmation email with the shipping status, the estimated and actual delivery time, and any change of the confirmed order by the customer can be done. At Emma, we manage our orders using an Order Management System. That's how a customer service agent can track and edit any existing order, or solve customers' issues. For example, if the customer wishes to change the delivery address or product after the purchase, we can support that! Post-Purchase Stage The Post-delivery stage covers all interactions customers have with Emma after receiving and using the products purchased. Product Experience: Good news! Your Emma product just arrived! The wait time came to an end, it's time to try your brand new Emma product. In this phase, customers are excited and full of expectations. They will finally pass through all the experiences Emma promised to deliver, from unboxing to actually trying the product. It's time to sleep better! Naturally, in this phase, some of the customers will seek guidance from Emma. It is important to highlight that lot of the hard work that went into encouraging the sale is wasted through poor management of the post-purchase customer experience. In this way, it's required from Emma Customer Service enough skills to manage customers' expectations, solve doubts, and even the ability to deflect a return. It’s significantly easier and approximately five times less expensive to retain customers than it is to bring in new ones. Please check this article: Return Deflection: Making Impact on Returns Retention/Advocacy : You need to try this Emma product! The last step in the journey transforms our regular customers into Emma brand promoters that spread positive word of mouth and enable our continuous growth. Recall the last time you had an amazing experience with a brand, How did you behave? Probably you want all your family and friends to feel the same, so you recommended and listed all the reasons why this brand is great.

Onboarding,Emma Sleep,Meet Emma: Our history,"Where it all began 2013 The journey began with our two founders, Manuel Muller and Dennis Schmoltzi, who were friends that shared the same vision: to improve people's lives by changing the way they sleep. At that time, the mattress market was still almost entirely based offline and characterized by products that were difficult to differentiate and prices that weren't transparent. As a first step, our founders wanted to ease the shopping process by taking it online. Team members: 7 Yearly revenue: €5.3 thousand It starts small-literally The first move was launching our multi-brand platform Dormando. In the beginning, we only sold other brands and the first sales were two Dunlopillo mattresses. Funnily enough, we ended up buying this brand in 2016. In these early stages. we were a team of just 7 and were working out of a tiny, 14m office which we nicknamed: ""The Foxhole"". Growth begins 2014 As our business model proved successful, we extend our product portfolio and, already convinced that the long-term solution would be omnichannel, we opened a showroom in Offenbach called Bettzeit. This also became the new office space we desperately needed as we added 13 new members to our team. Team members: 20 Yearly revenue: €538 thousand Emma is born 2015 While busy running and scaling Dormando, we decided to branch out and create our own brand alongside. We had the background needed to develop a great product: Manuel's previous industry experience with medical mattresses and our 2-year market experience with Dormando. Therefore, three months and many late nights later, Emma was born. We'd recognized early on that the principle of ""trying it out"" is the key to success-an idea that still determines our daily business today. This led us to offer consumers the novelty of mattress trials that lasted 100 nights with free delivery and returns. By now, we are at 55 team members and so we moved once again- this time to a 285 m2 office space. Team members: 55 Yearly revenue: €3 million Expanding into new markets 2016 We've always been ambitious and had our sights set on global growth. So, after launching the Emma mattress in Germany the previous year, we then launched it in Austria, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, and the UK as well. We also acquired Dunlopillo's brand rights for Germany and Austria. Setting the base for further growth by leveraging our ability in creating superior sleep products, we built up an in-house Research & Development team. With a wide variety of skills, this team pushes the boundaries of what material, technology, and neuroscience can do for sleep. Team members: 85 Yearly revenue: €20 million Emma breaks even 2017 This was the year where the Emma mattress won 2 awards: UK's Which? and Netherlands' Consumentenbond. This was proof of the quality of our product and that online mattress suppliers could successfully compete with traditional brands. ""Emma is a team with skin in the game"" and we value the impact of testing over endless planning-this ensures our accelerated growth. As a result, we expanded into 5 more countries and launched Emma in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. The decision to expand paid off and our yearly revenue reached 33 million-meaning Emma had now broken even. Team members: 130 Yearly revenue: €33 million Creation of Emma Sleep University 2018 Our growth continued to climb as we launched Emma in Sweden, Denmark, China, the USA, and India. And at 176 people, we had outgrown our office once again and moved to a new 2 061 m2 space. This accelerated growth is largely thanks to the ""Emma way"" - we're agile, execution-oriented, and move at a fast and efficient pace. We decided we needed a way to transfer this mindset to future Emmies. The solution? We founded Emma Sleep University. Team members: 176 Yearly revenue: €80 million Emma is online in 20+ markets 2019 The year began with us exhibiting at various trade fairs like IMM Cologne (Germany) and Salone del Mobile (Italy). We were on an omnichannel mission to disrupt the sleep industry. As a result, we launched our new Dunlopillo Smart Select Series which introduced our patented graphite technology to the market. Emma was now online in over 20 countries after launching in Ireland, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Canada. Intent on becoming a true international player, we opened Emma Southeast Asia in Manila. To stay focused, we decided to close Dormando and exclusively sell our own products. Team members: 290 Yearly revenue: €150 million Exponential growth 2020 Emma was going from strength to strength. In a single year, we sold 1.5 million mattresses and grew our yearly revenue by 170%. With this, we outpaced several competitors and established ourselves as the world's leading D2C sleep brand. Our monumental success didn't go up unnoticed and in April 2020 Emma merged with the Haniel Group. With Haniel as a strong partner at our side, we saw it as an opportunity to move to a whole new level of growth. Team members: 528 Yearly revenue: €405 million Reinventing sleep 2021 The dedicated work of Emma's Research and Development team meant sleep entered a whole new sphere as we launched Emma Motion. the world's most advanced smart mattress. Using innovative and proprietary technology, we now offer customers a product that silently adjusts to their sleeping positions throughout the night. With the launch of this mattress, we took a huge step towards fulfilling our mission: to change the way people sleep. Soon we'll provide an individual sunrise for everyone- stay tuned.

Onboarding,Product Information,About Foams: Simplified,"Table of contents E mma Foams What is density? What is compression hardness? Properties of Coldfoam / HRX Properties of viscoelastic foam/ memory foam/ adaptive comfort foam Properties of Gelfoam / Airgocell Properties of Diamond Degree Emma Foams Foams are the product of the reaction of Polyols and Toluoldiisocyanat (TDI). The Emma foams are not heated (cold foam). The Emma foams are stabilized and colored by additives. The Emma foams rolled with high pressure, so all Pores can open. The Emma foams differ in density, resilience, consistency, open pores, and compression hardness. What is density? Density means KG of material per cubic meter. The higher the density, the more stable the mattress. The higher the density, the heavier the mattress becomes. The higher the density, the lower is the breathability of the mattress is. Density is not the decisive factor of the hardness of a mattress but there is an influence. What is compression hardness? Compression hardness refers to the structure created within a foam by the action of pressure inside a foam. At a low compression hardness, the foam structure is neatly arranged on top of each other, the pressure exerted from above is distributed linearly in the mattress and the foam offers little resistance. The result - the mattress is very soft. Although, If you increase the compression hardness, you change the structure of the foam. In a simplified representation, you can imagine the structure as brickwork with staggered stones. The pressure exerted from above is distributed downwards in a pyramid shape and the foam acquires a significantly higher restoring force. The foam is very firm. Core Properties Properties of Cold foam - HRX Ideal support material for mattresses. Stable. Open-pored. High restoring force. Low-pressure relief. Adaptation through various cutting techniques. Properties of viscoelastic foam/ memory foam/ adaptive comfort foam Most adaptable foam. Visco offers the highest-pressure relief. Adapts pressure immediately and ensures a quiet lie. Extremely compact due to high density. Uneven lying behavior depends on the season. Visco has nothing to do with viscose - a textile fiber but describes the material behavior. Properties of Gelfoam / Airgocell More pressure relieving than cold foam, less pressure relieving than Visco. More resilient than Visco - but more elastic than cold foam. Best ventilated foam. Stable and durable. Properties of Diamond Degree Graphite particles are added to the surface of the mattress and topper. Underneath the foam is a graphite layer that dissipates the heat. Demonstrably more heat was conductive! It helps the body to reach the lowered sleeping temperature of 35.5 degrees faster. Relieves pressure like Visco. Conducts heat away in advance. Ideally ventilated. Prolongs restful deep sleep phases by up to 12%.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Tue Oct 14 13:37:26 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Product Information,About Springs: Simplified,"Springs When talking about springs is important to consider that: The higher the spring travel, the more adaptable a spring is! Bonell Spring For Bonell spring cores, the more rounds a spring core makes, the higher its quality. The correct term for this is gears. Bonell springs in the base of Emma Boxspring Beds can be very useful, especially if you want a low-priced but long-lasting product. Although, when choosing a mattress, due to the lack of point elasticity of Bonell Springs, it is more advisable to go for the pocket spring core mattress. All Emma Mattresses with springs use pocket springs . Pocket Springs The pocket spring core belongs to the genus of barrel springs and is characterized by its double conical shape. That is, the spring core is slightly wider toward the center and narrows slightly toward the top and bottom. The barrel spring core is not completely cylindrical. This gives it more elasticity. Because each spring moves individually and is connected only by small pockets, pocket spring cores are considered more point-elastic and adaptable than Bonell spring core mattresses. In addition to the height, the number of springs, and the quality of the springs used are also considered a burr gauge of quality. However, recent studies and tests by Stiftung Warentest show that above 250 springs per square meter there is no noticeable improvement in the lying properties. The materials with which the spring core is padded are more decisive here. Basically, all innerspring are considered to be particularly well ventilated, since more air can circulate within the mattress. Compared to traditional foams, they are the better choice for people who sweat a lot. However, since innerspring is made of steel, the mattresses are on average 20 to 25% heavier than an identical mattress made of foam. This is where you need to weigh things up when making a purchase.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Tue Nov 04 17:08:18 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Product Information,How to find the right mattress?,"TABLE OF CONTENTS How to find the right mattress ? Mattress property finder Questions beside the finder How to use the finder? Mattress property finder Personal preference against mattress recommendation Why the sleeping position is not applied in the finder ? How to find the right mattress? It is often a long way to the right mattress recommendation for the customer. This involves discovering the customer's needs, knowing the products and crowning this with a product recommendation. This article serves to help you. Mattress property finder Questions beside the finder Before using the product finder, you should clarify some basic conditions with the customer. Which mattress size is required and do we have it in our range at all? What is the customer's personal preference* in terms of firmness? It should also be clarified whether the mattress will be used by only one person or by several people. This is often the case with the 140x200cm mattress size. How to use the finder? Go through each category of questions with the customer. The customer's answers will give you an idea of what materials are needed to provide the customer with the best possible mattress. Please note that not every material is available in every market. Mattress property finder Personal preference against mattress recommendation In some cases, the recommended mattress may differ from the customer's preference. In some markets, customers prefer a firm mattress, which is not suitable for the customer in the individual case (Emma One hard or Emma O2 hard is returned because it is too firm). Point out to the customer that the shoulders and pelvis must sink in properly and the waist must be supported, regardless of the customer's stature, weight, or height! You are the expert! Why the sleeping position is not applied in the finder? In the statistics presented, the average time spent by side sleepers, stomach sleepers and back sleepers is shown. Two factors become particularly clear here: A back sleeper spends almost the same amount of time on the side as a side sleeper. A stomach sleeper also spends almost 25% of the night on his or her side. Due to the progressive structure of the mattresses (more supportive from top to bottom), Emma mattresses are also ideal for stomach sleepers.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Thu Nov 06 14:35:27 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Product Information,How to find your perfect Emma Pillow,"""How to choose a pillow” is often a question neglected by many people. Mattresses get a lot of attention these days and rightly so. After all, whether you get a good night’s rest will depend be tremendously on the type of foundation where we spend many hours of our lives sleeping. However, people often forget another component that is also extremely important: your pillow. Using a bad pillow can result in you waking up with pain in your neck and shoulders or other areas of your body. It can also affect your ability to fall and stay asleep. Your perfect pillow will depend on your body and sleep habits. Remember, your pillow should be comfortable and support your head, neck, and shoulders. So, how do you choose a perfect pillow? 3 Tips for choosing the perfect pillow Selecting a pillow does come down to individual preferences and your sleeping position, but here are some good tips to consider before you make your purchase: Choose the right filling Feather pillows (down pillows) might be an option for you if you prefer light and soft pillows that come from duck or goose fibres. However, these pillows can be quite expensive and are not hypoallergenic. Microfibre and cotton are options for those that need a hypoallergenic pillow that is also firm. Memory foam is for those that want a pillow that adapts to your specific shape. Memory foam pillows are also ideal for those with head, neck, or shoulder pain since they contour to the specific areas and offer support. Weight and size Depending on how much you move your pillow during the night, weight might be an important issue for you. Cotton and down pillows are lighter than memory foam and latex options. Most people will be happy with standard pillow sizes, which are also easier to find pillowcases for. If you decide to go with a smaller or larger pillow, make sure the case you select is the right size and that you aren’t stuffing your pillow inside the case or letting it lay in a sea of fabric. Breathable and Washable fabric Select a pillow with a breathable and washable pillowcase or cover. A breathable pillowcase will ensure that heat flows from your head to the pillow and out into the atmosphere, so you don’t overheat during the night. No one wants to wake up with sweat all over the neck or head, right? That is why we incorporated moisture-wicking UltraDry technology into our pillow. It guarantees you sleep cool and comfortable. Pillow for different types of sleepers Do sleep positions influence your choice of a perfect pillow? The short answer is YES. The answer is more complicated to explain since we all change positions during the night, so no one is a side or back sleeper all the time. That being said, there are probably some positions that you favour a bit more than others. For example, I rarely ever wake up on my side but more often on my back or stomach. Here are some basic rules that will help you in determining which pillow matches your sleeping style: Pillow For Stomach Sleepers Stomach Sleepers like soft pillows and in some cases, no pillow at all. Instead of having a pillow underneath their heads, front sleepers might opt for a pillow under their stomach and pelvis to attain alignment. Emma pillow is designed with this scenario in mind. The adjustable three-layer foam design makes it possible for you to remove any layer, and keep the one(s) that supports you the best. Pillow For Back Sleepers Back Sleepers usually favour a thinner, flatter pillow for keeping the neck in alignment with the spine. They may also favour a softer pillow. However, if you are already experiencing neck pain, a supportive pillow would also be an ideal choice. In this case, try to find a pillow that still feels soft but also provides sufficient support. With the Emma pillow, you can mix any two layers of foam to get the perfect level of support and comfort. As a back sleeper, I personally like to position the HRX foam layer at the bottom of the pillow, together with the ZeroGravity viscoelastic foam layer on the top of the pillow. While the top part contours my neck and relieves pressure, the bottom part gives enough support to keep my neck well-positioned. The combination is always flexible, treat this as a “Lego game”, you will find your best mix and match. Pillow For Stomach Sleepers Side Sleepers, on the contrary, would prefer a thicker, firmer pillow . According to SleepFoundation.org, a good rule of thumb is to find a pillow that is as thick as the distance between your shoulder and the opposite ear. Thinking about measuring the distance already? No need! At Emma, we believe that the best way to find your perfect pillow is to try it out yourself. Emma offers a 200 night trial period for not just its award-winning mattress , but also for its premium memory foam pillow. Why not take advantage of it and try Emma pillow out? Conclusion Choosing the right mattress means a lot for a night of better sleep, but the pillow also plays an equally important role when improving your sleep quality. It is critical you take your sleep habits into account when choosing a pillow. Besides, the right filling and cover also matter a lot. Most importantly, you should always try the pillow out before making your final decision. Try the Emma pillow , you will not regret it!",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Thu Nov 06 14:39:13 UTC 2025

Onboarding,Product Information,Temperature and Mattresses,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Knowledge Tidbits Do innerspring mattresses allow better airflow and temperature regulation than foam mattresses? Knowledge Tidbits Changes in temperature can influence the circadian rhythm (cf. card on ""circadian rhythm"") that dictates our sleep-wake cycle, and ultimately affect our sleep. Sleep onset usually coincides with the decline in the core body temperature. Therefore, sleep characteristics can be influenced by the thermal property of the mattress. A study showed that young individuals who slept on a high heat capacity mattress (HHCM) have more regular and pronounced sleep cycles over the course of the night as compared to individuals who slept on a conventional mattress. Participants also showed elevated deep sleep values in the second part of the night which is an important sleep stage that enables proper brain functioning and learning. A HHCM is able to efficiently conduct heat and remove excess body heat of the sleeper. This facilitates a reduction in core body temperature, which can enhance the sleep experience. Similarily, a high rise (HR) mattress topper is better at inducing a greater drop in core body temperature in the early stages of sleep than a traditional memory foam mattress. This reduction in temperature was observed regardless of age. Do innerspring mattresses allow better airflow and temperature regulation than foam mattresses? A study (Forrest R. Cannon & Emiel A. DenHartog, 2019) was conducted to assess the effect of an inverted heat plate of 35 °C on three different types of mattresses: innerspring mattress, foam mattress, and foam mattress with phase change materials (PCMs) Surface temperature, heat flux generated, thermal resistance and the time required to reach steady state thermal resistance were considered Differences in the thermal properties of the mattresses were found in the short term (initial 30 minutes) and long term: The innerspring mattress required a significantly higher heat flux to maintain a test plate surface temperature of 35°C after the first 30 minutes and for the rest of the experiment than the foam mattress or the foam mattress with phase change materials --> indicator that heat was released more easily from the innerspring mattress, and retained more strongly in the foam / foam PCMs mattress The innerspring mattress showed a lower average thermal resistance compared to the other mattresses both after the first 30 minutes and for the rest of the experiment --> meaning it released the temperature faster than the foam. This explains why an innerspring mattress might be perceived cooler and more comfortable on hot nights The spring mattress also attained the f astest its steady-state thermal resistance However, it should be borne in mind that this study worked with a heated plate and not with human subjects Humans have a more mixed interface between skin/possible clothing and mattress, with different pressure distributions and air layers between mattress and skin Recommendations by the experts at Emma When purchasing a mattress, comfort, size, and price are common factors considered by customers. However, the material of the mattress, in terms of heat conductance, is aso a crucial factor to consider. We recommend buying a mattress that has a high heat capacitance that can efficiently conduct body heat and reduce the body temperature during the course of the night. It helps to prevent hot and sweaty nights that we spent tossing and turning.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Tue Nov 18 11:31:34 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Product Information,The 3 steps for the right Mattress,"When supporting our customers in finding the right mattress, Emma CS should also focus on raising customer awareness regarding the product by providing clear information related to the following four topics: Ergonomics Pressure Relief Ventilation Ergonomics The healthiest posture for the spine is standing upright. Good mattresses try to bring the spine to a horizontal position during sleep. In the upright position, the vertebrae and intervertebral discs sit on top of each other and distribute the resulting pressure optimally. With load and movement, the intervertebral discs are stressed. Therefore, it is important that the shoulder and pelvis sink into the mattress, the waist finds support and the spine lies straight. Poor ergonomics on a mattress leads to: Frequent turning on the mattress Back pain Neck pain Tensions Headaches Stress Tiredness Sleeplessness Depression. Emma mattresses are ergonomically designed for all body shapes: Pressure relief The more point-elastic a mattress is on the surface, the less pressure on the skin, and the better is the blood circulation . Missing pressure relief can lead to: The hands fall asleep if there is no pressure relief. Circulatory disorders. Pressure pain in the Hip area. Pressure points at the Body. In rare cases, hands and feet can be colder. Emma mattresses with memory foam enable pressure relief: They adapt perfectly to your body shape. People with joint pain will appreciate the conforming ability of a memory foam mattress, as it gives the feeling of hugging the pressure points of the body. Provides spinal support. Memory foam conforms to your body, helping to keep your spine in neutral alignment. This ensures you won’t wake up with a sore back. Ventilation A well-ventilated mattress ensures that moisture is better removed and the sleeper has a better microclimate. Humans lose nearly 1L of body Fluids every night. Half of these are sweating. The other half we lose through the airways. 80% of the sweat-damp is discharged over the duvet. Heavy sweaters should go for a P ocket Spring Mattress , an Emma Diamond , or an Emma Fusion. Emma mattresses mentioned above enable: Temperature regulating. Facilitate the deep sleep phase. How does it work? - Emma Diamond explanation During the 1st hour of sleep: your body temperature reduces by 0.5° The heat of your body is absorbed by the mattress. On a normal mattress, the core warms up. With Emma Diamond, the following happens: Step 1 – The PCM coating on the downside of the top layer absorbs the heat Step 2 – Graphite and diamond particles release the heat away from the mattress to the edges of the mattress, where the extra heat is dissipated. After 1 hour, you will be in the deep sleep phase and your body temperature has dropped by 1.5°C. On a normal mattress, the heat loaded previously will return to you, making the foam under your body warmer. This will disturb your deep sleep phase and could awaken you. On the other hand, thanks to the release of the heat done by the Diamond Degree foam, the foam under your body has the temperature of your body. This will support your body to go into a deep sleep and will lengthen your deep sleep phase. These three points cover all relevant information to improve the customer's sleep in the long term.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Tue Nov 18 08:13:46 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Product Information,The Emma Mattresses: Benefits,"Table of Contents Emma One Emma One Pocket Spring Emma Original Emma Premium Hybrid Attention: More matresses will be available soon. Emma One Benefits: The Airgocell and Visco layers give the mattress a point-elastic surface. This means for the customer that the mattress adapts perfectly to the body. The HRX layer as a base supports the sleeper, thus preventing the customer from sinking too deeply into the mattress and having the feeling of sagging on the mattress. Due to the symmetrical structure, the customer can turn the mattress at any time, but not flip it. Due to the better cutting technique in the shoulder zone, the shoulder sinks deeper into the mattress to improve the sleepers' ergonomics. Thus, despite the slightly firmer lying properties, the mattress is adaptable in the shoulder. The cutting techniques of the mattress result in excellent ventilation, which reduces sweating. The polyester functional fabric in the cover very quickly wicks moisture away to the outside and ensures a dry sleeping climate. The functioning of the cover is similar to high-performance sportswear. Emma One Pocket Spring Benefits: The Airgocell and Visco layers give the mattress a point-elastic surface. This means for the customer that the mattress adapts perfectly to the body. The spring core consists of 250 springs per square meter. It ensures better ventilation of the mattress compared to the foam variant and is more suitable for people who tend to sweat more. By using different springs in the shoulder and pelvic area, the sleeper sinks deeper in the necessary places to improve the ergonomics of the sleeper. The pocket spring core makes it easier to turn on the mattress as it gives the necessary support by springing back. Due to the symmetrical structure, the customer can turn the mattress at any time, but not flip it. The polyester functional fabric in the cover very quickly wicks moisture away to the outside and ensures a dry sleeping climate. The functioning of the cover is similar to high-performance sportswear. Emma Original Benefits: The Emma Orignal is only available in one hardness. The Airgocell and Visco layers give the mattress a point elastic surface. This means for the customer that the mattress here adapts to the body. Since the Emma Original is equipped with 8cm of pressure-relieving foam instead of 3cm, the mattress is significantly more elastic and adaptable than the Emma One models. The HRX layer as a base supports the sleeper and thus prevents the customer from sinking too deeply into the mattress and having the feeling of sagging on the mattress. The symmetrical design allows the customer to turn the mattress at any time, but not flip it. The cutting technique in the shoulder area allows the shoulder to sink deeper into the mattress, improving ergonomics for the sleeper. Thus, the cutting technique further supports the pressure-relieving surface and provides excellent ergonomics on the mattress. The mattress' cutting techniques result in excellent ventilation, which reduces sweating. The polyester functional fabric in the cover very quickly wicks moisture to the outside and provides a dry sleeping climate. The functioning of the cover is similar to high-performance sportswear. Compared to the Emma One, this fabric is thicker and feels more sympathetic to the skin. Spinal Aligniment Original Spinal Alignment Original by Luma Moreira Comfort and Support Comfort and Support by Luma Moreira Emma Premium Hybrid Benefits: The Emma Premium Hy pocket spring is only available in one hardness. The mattress behaves firmer compared to the foam version. The spring core consists of 250 springs per square meter. The Airgocell and Visco layers give the mattress a point elastic surface. This means for the customer that the mattress here adapts to the body. Since the Emma Original is equipped with 8cm of pressure-relieving foam instead of 3cm, the mattress is significantly more elastic and adaptable than the Emma One models. The spring core ensures better ventilation of the mattress compared to the foam variant and is more suitable for people who tend to sweat more. The symmetrical design allows the customer to turn the mattress at any time, but not flip it. The use of softer springs in the shoulder and pelvic area provides improved ergonomics.

Onboarding,Product Information,Weighted Blankets for Sound Sleep,"Weight blankets may be an effective and safe intervention to foster calm, thus providing an innovative, non-pharmacological approach and a complementary tool to improve sleep quality. However, study evidence here mostly relates to patient groups. The size and weight of the blanket should be individualized to the person using it so that it is neither too heavy nor too light. Scientific evidence on the impact of weighted blankets Studies conducted so far primarily focused on patients suffering from depression, anxiety, ADHS (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism spectrum disorder, for example According to those studies, a weighted blanket can indeed help to feel calm and sleep better. Here’s a brief summary on selected studies: Study 1 (by Ekholm, B., Spulber, S., & Adler, M. (2020)): 120 patients (major depression, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, ADHS) slept with either a weighted metal chain blanket or a light plastic blanket for 4 weeks, sleep and daytime activity was monitored by wrist actigraphy After 4 weeks, the weighted blanket showed a significant advantage over the light blanket in terms of patients' insomnia (assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index) with a large effect size (Cohen's d 1.90) Patients who slept with a weighted blanket experienced: better sleep maintenance, higher daytime activity levels, reduced daytime fatigue symptoms depression and anxiety were also reduced in this group Side effects did not occur With continued use of the weighted blanket, the effects persisted during a 12-month follow-up Patients who switched from a light blanket to a weighted blanket later in the study also benefited and showed similar improvements in sleep and symptom reduction Study 2 (by Ackerley, Rochelle & Olausson, Håkan & Badre, Gaby. (2015)): 31 insomnia patients, not suffering from any other mental or physical disorder Following a baseline (pre-test) with their ordinary sleep blanket, study participants slept for 2 weeks with a weighted blanket; afterward, they returned the blanket and slept again for 1 week with their ordinary blanket (post-test) Sleep was measured using continuous actigraphy (Actiwatch) and comprehensive polysomnography (PSG) recordings in the participants’ own home Objective results of the study showed that the use of a weighted blanket compared to an ordinary sleep blanket resulted in: an increase in sleep duration a decrease in nocturnal movements Subjective assessments of the study participants were also documented and showed: that participants liked using the weighted blanket found it easier to fall asleep slept better felt more rested in the morning What’s the magic behind it? What could be the underlying mechanisms for the positive effect of weighted blankets? When we are stressed, our heart beats faster than usual This is accompanied by an activation of the sympathetic nervous system (also responsible for the activation of the fight-or-flight system), and our body is on edge To counteract this, (moderate) pressure may help, because: through pressure, the counterpart to the sympathetic nervous system, namely the parasympathetic nervous system, becomes activated, which results in a lowering of the heart rate This creates a feeling of calm and relaxation A weighted blanket may by this evoke sensations similar to the feeling of being hugged, caressed or held tightly A study (by Reynolds, S., Lane, S. J., & Mullen, B. (2015)) confirmed the effect of pressure stimulation on the activity of the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system: In a sample of 50 adults, it was shown that wearing a pressure vest (Vayu Vest) could reduce sympathetic arousal and simultaneously increase parasympathetic arousal after short periods of only 3 minutes In addition, better cognitive performance in brainteasers was observed, which, according to the authors, maybe due to the lower arousal when wearing the pressure vest What’s inside a weighted blanket? Fills can vary according to various parameters (above all, quality, cost and comfort). The most common fillers are steel beads, micro glass beads, sand, pebbles, and grains. Beads of steel are a popular filler for weighted blankets because they are robust, machine washable, and hefty, requiring fewer units to produce the required weight and pressure. Steel beads' primary disadvantage is typically louder than other materials. Glass microbeads are denser than other materials, which means less filler is needed, resulting in a thinner form. Micro glass beads are also machine washable. Sand may be used as a filler material, but it's not particularly popular. Indeed, clumping may be a significant issue when it comes to washing a sand-filled weighted blanket. In reality, following machine washing, specific sand blankets may not return to their former shape. The greatest problem with pebbles is that they are not always comfortable and their use can finally result in a less restorative sleep experience. Weighted blankets, may also be filled with uncooked grains, pasta, and dry beans. Grains and beans are widely accessible and low-cost, making them an appealing material for certain producers. On the other hand, these materials degrade with time, and are so, they are not a particularly long-lasting choice.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/product-information,Fri Oct 31 10:44:54 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Dreams: Lucid Dreaming: What Is It and How To Do It?,"What is lucid dreaming? Have you ever been in a dream where you have realized you are dreaming? Well if you answered yes, you have experienced a lucid dream. Put simply, “a lucid dream is defined as a dream during which dreamers while dreaming, are aware they are dreaming.” References to lucid dreaming date back to ancient times. Aristotle once wrote, “often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream”. The concept of lucid dreaming is also central to both the Tibetan Buddhist practice of Dream Yoga and the ancient Hindu practice of Yoga Nidra. More recently, Dutch psychiatrist and writer Frederik van Eeden first coined the term ‘lucid dream’ in his academic article entitled ‘A Study of Dreams” . If you have ever seen the movie Inception then you have encountered the concept of lucid dreaming before. The movie shows people possessing the ability to not just control the shape or content of their own dreams, but also of others. Such feats of ‘dream manipulation’ of others may seem too farfetched to be possible in our real lives however, they aren’t totally absent. When do lucid dreams occur? Lucid dreaming occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For some, it occurs spontaneously. However, others train themselves to start dreaming lucidly. The degree to which a person can influence their dreams varies. Some people, upon realizing they are dreaming, immediately wake up due to the adrenaline rush produced by the brain. Others may be able to influence their own actions, actions of others, surroundings, and any other aspect of their environment. It isn’t entirely clear how many people experience lucid dreaming. A study in Brazil surveying 3,427 participants with a median age of 25 showed a staggering 77% of respondents saying that they had experienced lucid dreaming at least once before. It is important to note however that a consensus exists that every person is capable, with practice, of lucid dreaming. How do I lucid dream? There are many techniques one could use to induce a lucid dream state. First, a common technique used to induce lucid dreams is one called “reality testing”. For example, during the day, a person may want to ask themselves “am I dreaming right now?” as they try to make their hand pass through their other hand or perhaps a solid wall. The technique purely relies on intention. In real life, the wall will (hopefully) remain solid and impenetrable, whereas in a dream the hand will easily pass through. Another technique is “waking back to bed”. This involves the sleeper setting an alarm to wake up them about 5 to 6 hours after going to sleep. Once awake, the sleeper should remain awake for a while before going back to bed. This technique can immerse the sleeper immediately into REM sleep, drastically increasing the chance of entering a lucid dream state. Another technique that is commonly used among avid lucid dreamers is using a dream journal. A dream journal is exactly how it sounds. It is a book used to record one’s dreams. Keeping a dream journal has been shown to increase one’s ability to remember their dreams when they wake up, lucid or otherwise. Lastly, probably the most effective method of inducing lucid dreams is meditation. Meditation trains people to become more aware of themselves and their surroundings. Many people meditate with the help of binaural beats or isochronic tones. These stimulate your pineal gland to produce the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate biological rhythms such as sleep and wake cycles. The sweet spot for the brain is generally around 40Hz. (you can find countless videos of 2 – 6-hour long binaural beats videos on YouTube). Concerns & Risks One concern people express about lucid dreaming, if they achieve it, is that they may get stuck in a dream and may find it more difficult to wake up. This is not a worrying risk at all. An individual is only able to sleep and dream for a set amount of time every night before the body automatically wakes up. In short, it is impossible for someone to get “stuck” sleeping. One rational concern is to do with sleep paralysis. If you want to induce a lucid dream state through meditation, you may go through the process of sleep paralysis. This is when your body falls asleep but your mind remains conscious and “awake” leaving you effectively, paralyzed. The process is 100% safe but can be quite frightening to sleepers, especially if it is achieved unintentionally. Many people experience pleasurable tingling feelings around the body, but some may experience frightening hallucinations. In Conclusion The mind is a complex thing. The vessel in which it is contained, the brain, is the most complex system in the universe. It is estimated that the brain has at least 100 trillion neural connections. That is at least 1,000 times more than the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Our planet’s top neuroscientists and psychologists are only beginning to knock on the door of its massive potential. Perhaps over the coming years, we will be able to gain a small insight into nature’s finest creation, and what goes on in it when we shut our eyes at night.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jul 18 18:12:51 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,"Dreams: When, How and Why do we Dream?","When do we dream? It may seem unnecessary (but it is not) to point out that we dream while we sleep . Sleep is a multifaceted event characterized (more or less homogeneously) by the lack of processing of external sensory stimuli . Such a condition is comparable to sensory deprivation : a situation characterized by the (voluntary) absence of sensory stimuli to which, very often, correspond very vivid images that can even lead to hallucinations. Why & how do we dream? The brain’s primary purpose is now thought to be consciousness . If that’s the case, consciousness is just the brain’s interpretation and integration of all the data it has access to at any given moment. In this sense, it is possible to claim that dreaming and hallucinations are variants of the same theme , based on the premise that the brain is active in all its states (wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM sleep). During normal wakefulness, the brain overlooks internally produced activity in favor of sensory input from the outside. Dreaming happens during sleeping because the brain is focused on endogenously evoked activity. The brain attends to external and endogenous activities concurrently under atypical circumstances, such as sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, or medicine or drug intake, resulting in hallucinations or wakeful dreaming. Numerous neurologic disorders and illnesses that are linked to hallucinations support this theory. From what has been said above, the idea that dreaming includes a reversed sequence of perceptual experiences is derived. Instead of bottom-up (i.e., from sensations to higher cognitive elaborations), top-down is used (i.e., higher cortical levels activating lower levels). Motivational systems in the brain are usually activated in response to goal-oriented activities. However, neural activity shifts away from the perceptual regions and toward the motor areas. Therefore, the dreamer imagines rather than engages in motivated behaviors. In addition, the reflecting system in the limbic brain is inactive, causing the dreamer to mistake the dream for reality. Indeed, damage to this region makes it difficult to tell the difference between dreams and reality when awake. FUN FACT Actually, the neuroscientific conclusions drown above are not so revolutionary. Indeed, Aristotle more than 2400 years ago addressed dreaming faculty as follow: “If, then, the exercise of the faculty of sight is actual seeing, that of the auditory faculty, hearing, and, in general, that of the faculty of sense-perception, perceiving; and if there are some perceptions common to the senses, such as figure, magnitude, motion, etc., while there are others, as color, sound, taste, peculiar [each to its own sense]; and further, if all creatures, when the eyes are closed in sleep, are unable to see, and the analogous statement is true of the other senses so that manifestly we perceive nothing when asleep; we may conclude that it is not by sense-perception we perceive a dream.” REFERENCES 1.

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Light x Temperature: Which factor impacts our sleep the most?,"The physical elements that interfere the most with our sleep are light and temperature . We know how light and a particular frequency of light can generate excitatory effects, inhibiting melatonin production and making us feel more alert and less willing to sleep. A legitimate question in this respect is: which element, between light and temperature, can influence our sleep routines the most? It is generally believed that in pre-industrial societies, the sleep of our ancestors was exclusively linked to the alternation of day and night. For this reason, many believe that in tribes and communities that lived without electricity, sleep coincided with sunset and awakening with sunrise. And for many years, this belief was also shared by academics. In 2015, however, a scientific research article entitled Natural Sleep and Its Seasonal Variations in Three Pre-industrial Societies was published in the leading scientific journal Current Biology . This article shows the results of a study conducted on three indigenous populations and attempts to answer the following question: How did humans sleep before the modern era? The answer to this question may help us to clarify the importance of light and temperature for our sleep. It has been argued that the invention of the electric light, followed by the development of television, the Internet, and related technologies, along with increased caffeine usage, has dramatically shortened sleep duration from ‘‘natural’’ levels and disrupted its evolved timing. Is it true? The researchers argue that: Light may not be as crucial for sleep patter as previously believed. The difference in sleep duration between our industrialized society and the pre-industrial one is not that great. The indigenous people have fewer sleep concerns when compared to post-industrial societies. Temperature plays a significant role in defining our sleep patterns. The experiment concerned three tribes: Hadza from Tanzania, Tsimane from Bolivia, and San from Namibia. In these societies, electricity and its associated lighting and entertainment distractions are absent, as are cooling and heating systems . Notably, none of these groups began sleep near sunset, with sleep onset occurring, on average, 3.3 hr after twilight. This shows how the rest of ancient societies were not synchronized with the alternation between night and day. On the contrary, the sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature . It terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the lowest point of daily ambient temperature. For this reason, the researcher concluded that the daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, can be a potent natural regulator of sleep . Another element that was researched was insomnia. Since it is a complaint that does not closely correlate to sleep, researchers evaluated the incidence of this complaint. The tribal population does not have a name for insomnia in their language. 5% of the participants indicated they occasionally had sleep onset issues. 5% sometimes had sleep maintenance problems. Less than 1/3 of these people reported that they experienced these issues frequently, i.e., more than once a year (1.5 percent and 2.5 percent of the total number of participants). These values are significantly lower than the 10–30 percent chronic insomnia rate observed in industrial cultures. For what concerns light: Moreover, the three groups regularly had tiny fires. The research also showed that waking occurred on average 1 hour before dawn; This fact supports the belief that sleep wasn't strongly connected to solar light. For what concerns temperature: Let’s now analyze the impact of temperature . The researchers discovered that the nocturnal sleep phase in the indigenous people was always beginning at declining ambient temperature. Therefore, they accurately monitored ambient temperature coupled with finger temperature and stomach temperature at the sleeping places. The results demonstrate that sleep in both the winter and summer occurred during declining ambient temperature and that awakenings happened towards the lowest point of the daily temperature cycle. Why is this very relevant for us? We can learn from this article the importance that temperature plays on the regularity of our sleep . Contrary to earlier belief, it is not only light that plays a central role in our biological rhythms. Temperature is an even more potent synchronizer than light itself. As proof of this, the study cited above shows that our sleeping and waking rhythms coincide precisely with the lowering and raising of atmospheric temperature. For this reason, we can use this knowledge to reinforce the idea that the correct temperature is fundamental to the quality of our sleep. In particular, our customer should not only take care to have a bedroom as free as possible of electronic gadgets that emit blue-light but, equally (if not more), they should take care to have a temperature difference in their bedroom that makes it easier for us to fall asleep. Moreover, this study shows the importance of technologies that ensure the natural decrease in body temperature in conjunction with sleep, such as a mattress with superior thermal properties. Knowing the importance of sleep, at Emma, we develop products with this in mind. The Diamond Degree mattress is designed to ensure the perfect temperature for your sleep . It is made of a particular layer of foam called Energex . It provides excellent thermal properties. Indeed, it is penetrable by water - so, if the customer is sweating, he or she will not sleep in direct contact with the body fluids (i.e., moisture-wicking ability). Moreover, this foam ensures that the sweat will ventilate out of the foam. And it also provides excellent breathability. Additionally, to ensure the perfect thermoregulation, the topper layer is infused with graphite – a good heat conductor – which ensures that the heat is dissipated as fast as possible.

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Snoring: What is it and how to treat it?,"What is Snoring? Have you ever had someone complain to you about your snoring? Have you ever had the displeasure of being in the same room as someone whose sleep noises sound like a Boeing 747 taking off? We all have had our bad experiences with snoring. It is a problem that affects roughly 30% of the population – one which can be a real pain in the backside and can cause you waking up on the wrong side of the bad and having a terrible day. Snoring may occur nightly or intermittently. Males and those who are overweight are most likely to snore. However, it is an annoyance that affects people of both genders. It can cause major disruptions to your own sleep and your bed-partners’. It can cause un-refreshing broken sleep which translates into poor daytime function. Heart disease is believed to be casually linked to snoring due to the adverse effects sleep deprivation can have on one’s heart. Furthermore, about half of people who snore loudly have obstructive sleep apnea. As you sleep your throat becomes narrow and “floppy”. As you breathe, the walls of your throat begin to vibrate. These vibrations lead to the characteristic sound of snoring. The narrower your airway becomes, the greater the vibration and the louder the snoring. If the walls of your throat completely collapse – which sometimes happens – this can result in the cessation of breathing. This is called Sleep Apnea. It is a serious condition that requires medical attention. There are many factors which lead to excessive snoring. For example, the natural aging process leads to the relaxation of the throat muscles, resulting in snoring. Anatomical abnormalities of the nose and throat, such as enlarged tonsils or adenoids exaggerate narrowing of the throat during sleep and therefore can lead to snoring. Sleep positions, such as sleeping on your back, may lead to snoring. Also, alcohol is can act as a substantial muscle relaxant and its consumption in the evening can lead to excessive snoring. Consuming muscle relaxants in the evening will worsen snoring too. Symptoms of Snoring We all know what snoring sounds like. A vibrating, rattling and sometimes floor- shaking sound one makes while breathing during sleep. It may be a symptom of sleep apnea. You should consult your GP if you snore excessively and have one or more of the following: Excessive daytime sleepiness Morning headaches Recent weight gain Worsening levels of attention, concentration, or memory Observed pauses in breathing during sleep. Treatment For Snoring If you are told that you have excessive snoring, then you may want to consult your GP. They will perform a physical exam and will decide whether you need to consult a sleep expert who will then conduct a sleep test and determine if you have sleep apnea. You have a series of options when it comes to treating snoring: Lifestyle modification: i.e avoid the risk factors seen above like alcohol, sleep position training if possible, treatment of allergies, etc… Surgery: should be a last resort but surgery on the back of the throat and roof of the mouth, or the nose if applicable. Appliances: these include mainly oral appliances constructed by a dentist experienced in treatment of snoring and sleep apnea, but also appliances such as nasal dilators Lastly a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) appliance which blows room air into the back of the throat and preventing its collapse. CPAP is the method of choice when combating sleep apnea. If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea it is very important you treat it aggressively. Untreated sleep apnea will lead to daytime dysfunction and puts you at a higher risk of vascular disease. Coping With Snoring People who suffer from mild and/or occasional snoring, who wake up feeling refreshed, and function well during the day need not worry but may want to try some behavior modifications before consulting a doctor: Maybe lose some weight Avoid sleeping pills, antihistamines & tranquilizers before bedtime Avoid alcohol for at least four hours and heavy meals or snacks for three hours before you night night Establish regular sleeping patterns Sleep on your side. For most, snoring isn’t too big of a problem. However, if it persists and worsens you should consult your physician.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Wed Dec 04 13:43:34 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,The Best Healthy Late Night Snacks,"We have all been there. Lying in bed, stomach growling, and struggling to fall asleep. It’s too late to cook a full meal so all you need is a nice healthy snack to stop the rumbling in your tummy and help you fall asleep. These are our favorite late-night snacks to satisfy those midnight cravings. Cereal & Milk Let’s start off simple. Probably the most basic breakfast out there – cereal with milk – is the first nibble on our list. One study found that eating high-glycemic carbohydrates, which most corn-cereals are before you hit the lab reduced the time taken to fall asleep. So, for all you Insomniacs out there this may be the answer! Keep the serving sizes low, especially if you suffer from heartburn, as heavy meals can exacerbate the problem. The calcium in dairy plays a fundamental role in the production of the sleep hormone melatonin and acts as a natural relaxant for the body. Bowl of Berries Another simple snack. Berries are not only loaded with fiber, which fills you up, but they also contain magnesium, which relaxes the nerves and muscles in your body. It’s probably best to serve your berries Han Solo or add some chopped nuts or granola, or a drop of milk. PBJ Our neighbors across the pond call it peanut butter and jelly. Others call it to choke and slide, fluffernutter, and even gooey gobbler. The peanut butter and jam sandwich is a perfect nighttime snack to help you get to sleep faster. Peanut butter contains an amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan gets converted in the brain to melatonin, which promotes sleepiness. However, carbs like bread and jam are needed to make tryptophan more available to the brain. Therefore, it is the perfect combo for a pre-slumber snack. Also, if you’re feeling extra fitspo you can opt for whole-grain bread and sugar-free peanut butter. Cheese & Crackers If you are in the mood for something savory, a safe choice is cheese and crackers. Keep an eye on your portion sizes though as eating a lot of cheese can rack up your caloric intake. You may want to opt for whole-grain crackers, which contain filling fiber. You can try adding some grapes, apple slices, or whatever fruit you please. Fun fact: Cheese has also been shown to increase the amount of time you spend in REM sleep. So, if you want to have some vivid dreams stock up on the cheese! Fresh Veggies & Dip If you want something crunchy and low in calories, then this will do the job. Any combination of raw carrots, broccoli florets, cucumber slices, celery, pepper, and many more can help eradicate that growl in your stomach. If you want to enhance the flavor and get some calcium into you also, then use a dip made from low-fat cottage cheese, hummus, or Greek yogurt. Popcorn Most people’s favorite snack is also a great late-night nibble to satisfy to those midnight munchies. 3 cups of air-popped popcorn have less than 100 calories and around 4 grams of fiber to satisfy that hunger. Skip out on the butter if you don’t want that dad bod. Fresh Fruit & Nuts This easy-to-make snack is an ideal option if you’r tired from a busy day. Both fruit and nuts bring a lot of nutritional benefits to the table (if you pardon the pun) including vitamins, minerals, protein, complex carbs, healthy fats, and fiber. Maybe try: An apple with a handful of almonds A banana with a dozen pecans Or a pear with some walnuts. You can also try spreading peanut butter on banana slices (a favorite of mine) or dipping apple slices in almond butter. Porridge An Irish person’s favorite go-to breakfast can also act as a great late-night snack. It is a fantastic source of beta-glucan, which is a filling fiber that can help keep your cholesterol levels in check. Try using some instant porridge with fat-free milk, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and some dried fruit. It will have you snoozing in no time. Kiwis These little furry delicious fruits are both nutritious and figure-friendly. Two Kiwis contain only about 93 calories, 5 grams of fiber, and 190% of your Vitamin C RDI. Kiwis are also one of few fruits containing a substantial amount of serotonin, which is the nerve messenger that relaxes your body and helps you fall asleep better. It also helps you curb your carb cravings. Pistachios These delicious little nuts stand out among others of their kind for their high levels of the sleep-promoting hormone, melatonin. Few plant foods contain as much melatonin as pistachios. One ounce (28 grams) of shelled pistachios, has about 160 calories and about 6.5mg of melatonin. The amount of melatonin typically recommended aiding sleep is 0.5mg – 5mg. To Sum It All Up If you’re hungry or even just bored late at night – eating a snack that’s under 200 calories really shouldn’t tip the scales. Aim for minimally processed foods like your fruits, nuts, yogurt, and eggs to make your tasty late-night munch. Remember, the most important thing to keep in mind when making healthy snacks is to enjoy them, so feel free to experiment and see what works best for you.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jul 18 18:12:51 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Why am I so tired during the lockdown?,"You might often have questions like, why am I so tired during the lockdown? What is wrong with me? Well, 2020 has been a somber year for most of us. Ok, who am I kidding? It’s been pretty terrible, and now many countries are facing a second lockdown right before the holiday season. As many go back to working 5 days a week from home and readjusting again to numerous hours spent at the same location, what have we learned thus far about proper sleep etiquette while in lockdown? Since the summer, there have been countless reports of people feeling more tired and groggy while working from home. Thanks to research and our sleep experts here at Emma, we have compiled a list of tips and habits to avoid that will ensure that you keep getting quality sleep even if your work routine is constantly changing. What makes you feel tired during this pandemic? Before heading right into the tips, let’s investigate what people are saying has changed in their lives since lockdown as it relates to sleep. All of these problems can be linked to “sleep inertia,” or when the body is still in a transitional state of being asleep and being awake. An increase in clumsiness – Maybe you are dropping all your pens or breaking plates on a more frequent basis. Perhaps you are making more mistakes in your work than you would have in the past. Or maybe you keep tripping on the same magenta carpet runner even though you’ve told yourself for years that you would replace it, but nevertheless, here it stays… Constantly distracted – This is a big one for me to be quite honest. I am one of those people who will be in the midst of writing an extraordinary article and then a bird flies by my window and suddenly I’m— “Where did it go? What kind of bird was that? I wish I was a bird…” Then I’ve lost fifteen minutes because of a pigeon. In a state of confusion – Are you finding it hard to remember things? Have you forgotten appointments that you would have never forgotten before? Sometimes even speaking with confidence and clarity is a chore. One time I called my boss by my boyfriend’s name, and well, it was awkward… All of these conditions can cause many problems for us when working from home while still having to meet deadlines and host virtual meetings. Sleep inertia can last anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour, and for some people, it can last several hours. This is why it is so important for us to take action to minimize our fatigue so that we wake up feeling refreshed and ready to be productive. How to fight against fatigue during the lockdown? Getting rid of fatigue is not as hard as you imagined, we summarised four easy-to-follow steps for you to get through this period. Step One: Go Outside Make sure you are going outside at least a few times a day when it is possible. The reason for this is that sunlight helps regulate our bodies. When it is light outside and we are exposed to the sun’s rays, our bodies naturally wake up and feel more alert. It also suppresses the release of melatonin which is the natural hormone that makes us feel sleepy. Likewise, when we are not exposed to sunlight as well as in the evening hours, the body starts to wind down and release melatonin. More often than not, people are spending way more time inside without going outside except for occasional trips to the supermarket and pharmacy. It would be wise to increase the frequency of going outside and combine it with some physical activity like jogging or just taking a walk around the neighborhood. Step Two: Don’t Break the Routine It can be really tempting to stay up until 2 am watching The X Factor or the latest Netflix show, but remember that you would not normally do that during the workweek so why are you doing it because you are working from home now? It is important for us to keep our schedules the same, so our bodies fall into the natural rhythm of feeling sleepy in the evenings and sleeping through the night. There is nothing worse than falling into that vampire mode of being wide awake at night and exhausted throughout the day. If you do find yourself unable to sleep during the night, get out of bed for a bit a do a simple task like washing dishes or reading to help ease your mind back into rest mode. Lastly, (and I know you’re going to hate it) don’t hit the snooze. Ok, maybe one time but if you had a bad night of sleep, it’s better to make it through the day tired than trying to get an extra hour or two, which throws off our sleep routine. If you need a mid-day nap, then take around 20 minutes to recharge but no longer. Step Three: Prepare Your Bedroom Have a bedroom ritual yet? If not, you can read our blog post about nighttime routines to get an in-depth understanding of how they can benefit your sleep. Basically, you want to optimize your bedroom for falling asleep. Make sure the temperature is exactly how you want it, preferably a little cool but not freezing. Have clean sheets on the bed and things put away in their correct stations. You don’t want to fall asleep in chaos but to an orderly, relaxing environment. If you like to fall asleep with white noise or quiet instrumental music, then go ahead and play our Sleepy Dreams playlist on Spotify . Have your windows closed and your shutters or blinds pulled so the sunlight does not wake you too early. All this preparation will help your body settle down when you finally hit the sheets and ease you into a relaxing slumber. Step Four: Do Something Relaxing Before Bed What can help you relax before sleeping? That might be yoga, reading, meditation, chatting with your close family or friends, or watching TV. Only you can know what will really calm you down and get you into your sleep state. We suggest that you start your relaxing activity at least an hour before you want to be asleep. Also, make sure that you aren’t relying upon alcohol or sleep tablets to make you feel sleepy. Alcohol has been proven to reduce quality sleep and leave you feeling worse in the morning. Tablets can also make you become dependent on chemicals to get to sleep, and over time your body will become somewhat immune to the dosage. If you are having serious problems with sleep deprivation, then please consult your physician to get a professional opinion. We hope you learned something from this blog post and that you can use it to make your life in lockdown a little easier. Remember that you aren’t alone out there and that millions of others are having to deal with these drastic changes. Make sure you give yourself a break from time to time and take care of yourself.

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Insomnia,"Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and refers to an inadequate ability to generate sleep, despite allowing oneself the adequate opportunity (!) to fall asleep. Meaning, patients provide enough time for rest (e.g. 7-9 hours at night) but cannot produce sufficient sleep quantity or quality. Insomnia can be divided into specific sub-types, although they are not mutually exclusive, which means they might occur together or separately: Onset Insomnia : Difficulty falling asleep Maintenance Insomnia : difficulty staying asleep To be diagnosed with insomnia it must occur at least three nights each week for more than three months (to separate insomnia from temporary sleep problems), lead to significant stress or daytime impairment , and stand independent from other mental disorders or medical conditions that could otherwise cause sleep disturbance (e.g. depression, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes). Prevalence rates of insomnia are estimated at 1 0-30% of adults ; however, rates are likely to be far more widespread with women affected twice as often as men. The two most common triggers of insomnia are emotional concerns or worry , and emotional distress or anxiety . On the biological level, emotional arousal leads to an overactive sympathetic nervous system, which controls the body’s fight-or-flight mechanism, resulting in increased heart rate, blood flow, metabolic rate, brain activity, and release of the stress-negotiating hormone cortisol. All of which makes it extremely difficult for our body to rest and fall asleep . Treatment The treatment for insomnia includes medication, psychotherapy, or behavioral therapy. On the one hand, they only promote sleepiness for a short time, thereby delaying the time needed to fall asleep, but distorting the natural sleep pattern (more sleep in N2, less REM sleep, and deep sleep). On the other hand, sleeping pills make people highly dependent on them while at the same time creating tolerance for the sleep-promoting effects, i.e. an ever-higher dose is necessary to achieve the same effects, and once patients stop taking the medication, they frequently suffer even more from insomnia than before, which is called rebound insomnia (the brain alters its balance of receptors as a reaction to the increased drug dose). In addition, those taking the medications often suffer from fatigue and reduced alertness the next day, whereby chronic use of sleeping pills even leads to a reduction in general life expectancy. For this reason, the use of sleeping pills should only be used infrequently and in a highly controlled manner!!! Another and more promising approach to counteract insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) . Here, patients learn a set of techniques to improve sleep habits , address anxieties , for example. CBT-I allows for patient-focused treatment strategies and responses to individual needs.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jul 18 18:12:23 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Jetlag,"What happens when we suffer from jetlag? Jetlag is a temporary disruption in circadian rhythm when travelling time zones. Our body works on an internal ~24-hour sleep-wake cycle (called circadian rhythm, cf. card on circadian rhythm) which is influenced by and can adapt to environmental cues , such as light. Review our Circadian Rhythm article here for more information. When travelling time zones , our circadian rhythm takes longer to adapt to the new time zone than the aeroplane on which we travelled. Consequently, our internal clock is somewhat desynchronised with the new environment . This may lead to daytime sleepiness , headaches , stomach problems or difficulties falling asleep . Jetlag is particularly hard to push when travelling eastward . This is since phase-shortening (east is ahead of time to west) is more difficult to adjust to than phase-lengthening (west is behind east). It is harder for us to fall asleep earlier as usual than staying up a bit longer when travelling westwards, especially since our circadian rhythm is innately a bit longer than 24 hours (~24 hours and 15 minutes), so eastward travelling contradicts our internal clock even stronger, whilst westward travelling approaches our internal clock. Rule of thumb : it takes one day per time zone crossed to adjust, i.e. travelling 2 time zones takes approximately 2 days to adjust. Exposing yourself to sunlight supports re-synchronising your circadian rhythm faster and fighting jetlag!",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jul 18 18:12:22 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that severely disrupts the body’s sleeping and waking cycles. It is characterized by extreme daytime drowsiness and is caused by abnormalities in the central nervous system and emerges in most cases in childhood to young adulthood. It affects the systems in the brain that help us stay awake, such as the brain stem and hypothalamus. The most prominent symptoms of this condition are sleep attacks (in which the desire to fall asleep is overwhelming), cataplexy (sudden bouts of muscle weakness), and sleep paralysis (a temporary inability to move while falling asleep or waking up). Frequent Symptoms Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) The hallmark of the condition (everyone with narcolepsy has it), EDS causes people to become extremely drowsy during the day, leading to sleep attacks. It arises regardless of how much sleep a person gets. These are short periods in which the desire to sleep comes on quickly and is insatiable. In between sleep attacks, narcoleptic people feel rested and alert. Cataplexy A significant portion of narcolepsy cases also entails cataplexy. This sudden bout of muscle weakness, absence of muscle tone, and loss of voluntary motion often arise when a narcoleptic person experiences strong emotional responses, as in laughter, pangs of fear or stress, or sudden excitement. The severity of this condition ranges, with some experiencing only a few of these attacks in a lifetime, while others have multiple episodes a day. Sleep Paralysis Arising when narcoleptic people are close to falling asleep or just waking up, sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to perform voluntary movements or speak. A condition that lasts anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, it resembles cataplexy and the state of the body when people are in the dream state of sleep (called REM). As with these conditions, the debilitation isn’t permanent and doesn’t have lingering effects; people quickly regain the ability to speak and move as expected. Hallucinations Vivid hallucinations often accompany sleep paralysis and may arise when a narcoleptic person is falling asleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or shortly after waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations). These are most often visual in nature—though other senses can also be affected—and they may take on a frightening or jarring character. While the symptoms themselves aren’t lethal, they’re certainly disruptive, and they can cause car accidents, falls, or other issues. If you or someone is experiencing EDS or other symptoms—the recommendation is to always seek professional help and the best would be a Sleep Expert doctor. Treatments Currently, there is no cure for narcolepsy, but medications and behavioural treatments can improve/help to cope with symptoms. There is a drug commonly prescribed to help with daytime sleep attacks. But also antidepressants are often used to fight cataplexy and sleep paralysis, which again do not eliminate the symptoms completely and come with their own downsides. Behavioural treatments are also a good option, which includes taking short naps during the day, practising good sleep habits (e.g. avoiding caffeinated drinks late in the day, consistent bedtime routines), flexible arrangement of social / work-related engagements",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu May 15 16:47:51 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Sleep Apnea,"What is sleep apnea? Sleep apnea is a disorder that involves the complete or the temporary stopping of breathing at intervals of at least 10 seconds during sleep. This leads to a decrease in oxygen content in the blood and sleep fragmentation . It usually affects men aged between 40 and 70 years old. It also commonly occurs in elderly individuals and those suffering from obesity. In general, this sleep disorder can be divided into three categories: Obstructive apnea: This involves real airway obstruction. Central apnea: In this case, the malfunctioning of the respiratory activity is due to a temporary loss of the nervous stimulus on the way to the respiratory muscles. Mixed apnea: This last type is simply a mix of the two previous types of apnea. Symptoms and effects of sleep apnea Usually, the most common symptom of sleep apnea is snoring . In fact, due to the dysfunction of the breath, this becomes stronger. For example, prolonged breathing pauses, groans, and puffs are observed in sleepers who suffer from sleep apnea. The causes of sleep apnea can vary, but aggravating factors include the use of sedatives, hypothyroidism, nasal obstruction, or the supine position during sleep. The effects of this disorder may include difficulty falling asleep at night , excessive tiredness during the day , frequent headaches, and concentration problems . Moreover, it has also been identified as a risk factor for other clinical consequences such as systematic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke. Studies have also shown that men suffering from sleep apnea have significantly lower levels of the hormone testosterone than those of a matching comparison sample not suffering from sleep apnea. Risk factors associated with sleep apnea that might increase vulnerability for the disorder. The risk factors are advancing age, male sex, obesity, family history, menopause, craniofacial abnormalities, heavy cigarette smoking, and alcohol use. Medical treatment and advice Although sleep apnea is recognized as a serious disease, it often stays undetected. Here, sleeping partners or familiars can help to report any abnormalities during the night (e.g. heavy snoring, breathing problems/pauses during sleep). Early recognition helps appropriate and effective therapy , counteracting serious health consequences. Treatment of milder forms of sleep apnea includes weight reduction, quitting smoking, maintenance of a regular sleep pattern, or treatment of nasal allergies to support better breathing at night. If symptoms do not improve or in case of severe sleep apnea, various treatments/devices are possible: the most common and reliable method is CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure), a machine you put on before going to bed which delivers air pressure through a mask to keep the upper airway passages open. Others are oral appliances designed to keep your throat open, or supplemental oxygen machines to counteract a shortage of oxygen during sleep. But these are only a few examples of a range of possible treatment methods. Fun-fact Snoring is a problem that makes no economic distinction. Indeed, did you know that Tom Cruise uses to sleep in a soundproof ""snoratorium"" because his night sleep is characterized by loud snoring? Did you know that sleep apnea can be related to sexsomnia. It is a relatively uncommon parasomnia mainly affecting males. Sexsomnia happens during non-REM sleep and is not linked to dreaming. Although aberrant sexual activity during sleep was initially reported in 1989, the term ‘sexsomnia’ wasn’t created until 2003 when 11 individuals displaying sexual activities during sleep were recorded.

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Sleep Paralysis,"Sleep Paralysis As explained in our Sleep Cycles article , during REM sleep our skeletal muscles are completely paralyzed: no tone in the voluntary muscles of the body (involuntary muscles which control automatic operations like breathing continue to operate!) Normally, when we wake up and return to consciousness, the brain releases the body from paralysis immediately. In the case of narcolepsy ( a sleeping disorder ), it may occur that paralysis prolongs into the state of being awake. This leads to an inability to move your body – not even eyelids or mouth. Within some minutes, the paralysis should cease, and f ull-body control should be regained. Paralysis, however, is not unique to narcolepsy but can also occur among healthy individuals. Generally, paralysis does not pose any worrying risks, however, if it occurs regularly or is getting worse, you should see your doctor. It has not yet been fully understood why paralysis develops but it has been linked to other (sleeping) disorders or irregularities, e.g.: insomnia, disrupted sleeping patterns due to shift work or jetlag, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, panic disorder. A regular sleep rhythm, measures that promote a good night's sleep in general, and adherence to sufficient sleep duration help to prevent paralysis.

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Social Jetlag,"What is social jetlag? The term jetlag is normally associated with long-distance flights where it refers to a temporary disruption in circadian rhythm when travelling time zones. The circadian rhythm is the body’s internal sleep-wake cycle which repeats roughly every 24 hours and is hence called circadian (from Latin “circa diem”, for “approximately one day” Review our Jetlag article here & the Circadian Rhythm article here. But for a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, you do not necessarily need an aeroplane! Our social or professional everyday life can also throw us out of phase. How? This question is actually easy to answer: Our day has 24 hours - but quite often, our schedule calls for many more To do justice to all tasks or events, we start cutting back on time at one particular juncture: our sleep. ""I don't need that much sleep!"" or ""I'll catch up on my sleep at the weekend!"" While our body actually wants to shut down and needs sleep to recover , our social circumstances do not allow us to meet this need and we postpone and most likely shorten our sleep time. Our social clock is entering into competition with our biological clock, so to speak. What are the consequences of social jet lag? Social jetlag, like travel-related jetlag, can lead to daytime sleepiness, headaches, stomach problems or difficulties falling asleep. It is usually more frequent and longer-lasting than our holiday trips by plane, a serious burden of sleep debt can accumulate. This has damaging cumulative effects - both short and long-term - that result in wide-ranging and dire consequences on our health, such as: a weakened immune system, a rise in the risk of many diseases including cancer, hypertension, coronary diseases, stroke, obesity and diabetes But also, psychological distress and disorders can be associated with sleep deprivation due to social jet lag, for example: Listlessness, anxiety, and depression A note to all “weekend dormice” among us: sleep debt cannot simply be made up with a few extra hours Studies have demonstrated that individuals who cut their sleep down to five hours during the week but make up for it on the weekend with extra sleep, still pay a cost! What promotes social jetlag? Besides a busy schedule, social media in particular have emerged as a risk factor. The reason for this is that many of us like to exchange some news, watch the latest holiday pictures of our friends or funny videos in the evening before going to bed. This, however, increases the likelihood of losing sleep, because: The exchange of exciting news will make us more awake again Once in hand, we often find it difficult to put the phone away and spend we spend a lot of valuable time being hijacked from sleep Exposure to artificial lighting emitted by the screens of the TV, tablets, computers, mobiles etc., can adversely impact sleeping behaviour and sleep continuity by inhibiting melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone Especially among teenagers the evening hours are popular, to socialise or relax and they prefer to go to bed later. To still have enough restorative sleep they needed to sleep in later in the morning than younger children. However, as our schooling system usually does not allow time for late mornings, this can also lead to social jetlag. A fact that is reflected in impaired mental and cognitive performances among many pupils and students. Hence, many sleep scientists urge that all this is to be taken into account when it comes to the management and structure of everyday school life.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jan 30 16:40:18 UTC 2025
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Circadian Rhythm,"Table of Content Intro What is a circadian rhythm? Why do we need a circadian rhythm? How does the circadian rhythm (in humans) work on a neurobiological level? What happens when our circadian rhythm is out of tact? What factors can influence our circadian rhythm? What are chronotypes and how are they related to circadian rhythms? Intro The circadian rhythm , also known as our Inner clock , does not only manage when we sleep but actually all regular behavior, as eating for example. The inner clock is determined by different factors as gym, hormones, temperature, and our behavior. However, the most important and influencing factor comes from light. Through our eyes, Our brain is constantly receiving signals by receptors sensitive of blue eye - setting out our internal clock Besides, other processes, substances created also raise the need of sleep. What is a circadian rhythm? Let’s start at the very basic: The term circadian comes from Latin and is composed of the terms circa (approximately) and Diem (day) In chronobiology, circadian rhythms are defined as processes with a period length of about 24 hours, hence the circa + Diem. These cycles are determined internally , we speak of an endogenous rhythm or an internal clock - in contrast to processes that are generated by external factors and therefore exogenous. The ~24-h rhythm repeats itself continuously unless we influence it by external forces - but more about that in a minute. Probably the best-known circadian rhythm is the sleep-wake rhythm , which causes us to switch repeatedly between sleep and wakefulness - yesterday, today, and tomorrow. However, other physiological parameters also exhibit a rhythm with a ~24-hour period, e.g. our body temperature or the secretion of certain hormones fluctuate in a 24-hour rhythm. Why do we need a circadian rhythm? With the rotation of the earth, there are periodically recurring changes such as changes from brightness to darkness, warmer and colder temperatures, but also aspects such as availability of food or lurking threats. Living organisms that adapt to such changes can optimize their ability to function and thus ensure their chances of survival. This is why circadian rhythms are not only found in humans, but also in animals and plants (activation of photosynthesis). The essential function of the circadian rhythm is to classify life processes in terms of time. For example, the activation and deactivation of individual processes in the body enable us to sleep and regenerate at night but to be fully functional, alert, and active during the day. How does the circadian rhythm (in humans) work on a neurobiological level? Circadian rhythms throughout the body are linked to a central circuit, sometimes called the circadian pacemaker . This pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) - part of the hypothalamus - just behind the root of your nose. The SCN is very sensitive to light, which is why light exposure is closely linked to the circadian rhythm. The SCN is very sensitive to light, which is why light exposure is closely linked to the circadian rhythm. In darkness, the SCN sends a corresponding signal to the pineal gland, which in turn produces, among others, the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. What happens when our circadian rhythm is out of tact? If the circadian rhythm is disturbed, it has major influences on our ability to function properly. Our hormone production would go haywire, blood pressure, body temperature or heart rate, etc, would no longer follow the sequence to which we have adapted over the years. Not only can this pose serious health risks, but it would also significantly reduce our well-being and productivity. If our internal clock no longer signals ""night"" to our body, it stays on high alert. Consequently, we have difficulty falling asleep and repeatedly wake up during the night or early in the morning. This is accompanied by sleep fragmentation, lower sleep efficiency, and also poorer quality sleep. What factors can influence our circadian rhythm? Light is the main synchronizer, also called key Zeitgeber, of our internal circadian clock: Light affects the production of melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone that signals night to the body. Melatonin production slowly increases at the onset of darkness and stays elevated for the course of an approximately twelve-hour period. Although melatonin does not participate in the generation of sleep itself, it increases the sleep pressure we feel (i.e. tiredness and need to sleep), and thus times when sleep is going to occur. During the day, however, melatonin levels should be low as we do not want to feel tired. The suppression of melatonin by natural/artificial light is hence intended and called for during the day as it promotes attention, alertness, and mood. For more information on the impact of light cf. our card on “Light & Circadian Rhythm” > “Artificial Light” / “Blue Light” / “Light Therapy” Our social activities can have an impact, too: Breakfast/dinner times, social events and parties in the evening, etc. can have an impact on our daily rhythm as they give a temporal structure to our everyday life. The relationship between the circadian rhythm and food intake is also used for nutrition tips: this is referred to as the principle of chrononutrition or time-restricted-eating (TRE) It is a form of intermittent fasting in which daily food intake is adapted to the circadian rhythm and limited to a period of 4-12 hours It does not require calorie restriction, but a consistent daily eating window A systematic meta-analysis of 19 studies from 2020 (Moon et al.) found positive effects of TRE on our bodies, including weight loss, reduction in fat mass whilst maintaining fat-free mass, blood pressure and cholesterol profile Depending on its intensity, we even speak of social jetlag Check more information about J Jetlag - A factor all too familiar to globetrotters and business travelers: When traveling time zones, our circadian rhythm takes longer to adapt to the new time zone than the airplane on which we traveled. Consequently, our internal clock is somewhat desynchronized with the new environment. This may lead to daytime sleepiness, headaches, stomach problems, or difficulties falling asleep. Jetlag is particularly hard to push when traveling eastward. Check more information about Jetleg here What are chronotypes and how are they related to circadian rhythms? While all of us have circadian rhythms, this does not mean that they are all in sync between individuals. While some people may sleep earlier, or reach the lowest point of body temperature earlier in the evening, others may find sleep only later in the night, etc. These inter-individual differences in the circadian rhythms are expressed in different chronotypes . Generally speaking, a distinction is made between the morning type (also known as the lark) and the evening type (known as the owl). Morning types wake up earlier and reach their cognitive and energetic peak already early in the day. In return, they also become tired in the evening more quickly and reach their lowest core body temperature earlier in the night than evening types, for example. Evening types take longer to wake up in the morning - this may be due to a later onset of cortisol secretion - but are still wide awake when others are already fast asleep. But of course, the story is not quite as black and white! There are many subcategories and by now a number of questionnaires or tests are available to determine one's own personal chronotype. Fun-Facts Research shows that people go to bed later in the days leading up to a full moon and are sleepless, although the reasons are unclear. What makes this discovery even more interesting is that the effect of the full moon is exerted both on populations living in urban contexts, suburban contexts, and rural contexts (having, therefore, different exposure to sunlight and moonlight).

Onboarding,Sleep Science,How much Sleep do I need?,"There is no ""one size fits it all"" answer to the question of how many hours of sleep we need, as the amount of sleep you need depends on a variety of factors such as age, health, lifestyle, etc. But according to the National Sleep Foundation , the general recommendation is: 14-17 hours for new-borns 12-15 hours for infants 11-14 hours for toddlers 10-13 hours for pre-schoolers 9-11 hours for school-aged children 8-10 for teenagers 7-9 hours for young adults and adults 7-8 hours for older adults Curiosity about teenagers sleep habits : Teenagers may find evening hours especially attractive to socialize or relax and prefer to go to bed later. To still have their amount of sleep needed to feel refreshed they are hence also likely to sleep later in the morning than younger children. This also corresponds to the fact that our internal clocks (circadian rhythm) shift during puberty. Check out the Circadian Rhythm article here Sleep Scientists urge that all this be taken into account when it comes to everyday school life, as many teenagers were regularly deprived of important hours of sleep in the morning and consequently showed impaired mental performance. ""Am I getting enough sleep?"" If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, here are three questions that might help you: Do you have trouble getting up in the morning? / Would you have slept past your alarm clock? Do you have trouble focusing during the day? / Can you function optimally without caffeine? Do you regularly doze off during the day? Deep Sleep Deep sleep, also called slow-wave sleep because of its characteristic brain waves, is crucial to feeling refreshed the next morning. Deep sleep is considered to be the most restorative sleep phase and is associated with vital functions, among such: production of growth hormones, strengthening of the immune system, repair and regrow of body tissues, and memory consolidation. Deep sleep occurs in longer periods during the first third of the night with adults spending about 10-20% of total sleep time in deep sleep. However, the assumption that deep sleep alone determines how long we should sleep is wrong ! Alongside deep sleep, the remaining sleep stages also bear significant functions . Check out our article of Sleep Stages here What happens when you are sleep-deprived ? Not getting enough sleep leads to sleep debt , which is essentially the difference between the amount of sleep we get and the amount we need . Studies have shown that people who sleep five hours or less on weekdays, but extra long on weekends, still pay a significant cost. Among them, for example, is an increased weight gain due to: excessive caloric intake in the evening (the longer we stay awake, the more hormones are released that boost our hunger and appetite), reduced energy expenditure, and changes in the body's use of insulin; impaired cognitive and physical performance; increased sensitivity and irritability; and many more. A study conducted by the AAA Foundation in Washington, DC, in 2016 quantified a driver’s relative risk of being involved in a car crash relative to their sleep deprivation. They found that drowsy driving leads to significantly higher crash rates: up to 11.5 times the crash rate when sleeping less than 4 hours compared to drivers who had slept for at least 7 hours. Therefore, it is crucial to get the recommended daily amount of sleep and practice sleep hygiene regularly – for your own good and for your fellow men! Deep sleep is considered to be the most restorative sleep phase and is associated with vital functions, among such: production of growth hor What happens when you oversleep ? While we know that too little sleep can lead to serious and significant impairments, we cannot deduce a linear relationship between sleep and health/performance, according to the idea of “more is more”. Rather, there seems to be an inverted U-shaped relationship: Neither too little nor too much sleep is advisable – but the golden mean. Just like over-eating, over-drinking, over-breathing is detrimental to our health, over-sleeping is most likely to come with drawbacks too! It is best to remember that too much of anything can be bad. From an evolutionary perspective , sleeping at night is considered adaptive to protect us from accidents or predators in the dark and to preserve energy reserves. During the day, however, our bodies are equipped to be active, to forage, and reproduce. An extended period of sleep would here be maladaptive! Oversleeping is often associated with physical or mental disorders , such as sleep apnea, depression, or side effects of medications. Effects that may be linked to over-sleeping include diabetes, obesity, back pain, depression, heart disease, for example. Fun Fact Tigers rest for 16 hours a day. A giraffe, on the other hand, only needs two hours of sleep a day. And a snake can even sleep for up to three years!

Onboarding,Sleep Science,Light & Circadian Rhythm,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Why does light matter in general? What happens when we are exposed to light? Blue Light Artificial Light Why does light matter in general? As per our Circadian Rhythm article, Light is the main synchronizer , also called key Zeitgeber, of our internal circadian clock which defines our ~24h sleep-wake cycle. Light affects the production of melatonin , a sleep-inducing hormone that signals night to the body. Melatonin production slowly increases at the onset of darkness and stays elevated for the course of an approximately twelve-hour period. By this, melatonin helps maintain the body’s internal sleep-wake cycle which repeats roughly every 24 hours and is hence called a circadian rhythm (from Latin “circa diem”, for “approximately one day”, cf. card on Sleep Cycle or Circadian Rhythm). Although melatonin does not participate in the generation of sleep itself , it increases the sleep pressure we feel (i.e. tiredness and need to sleep), and thus times when sleep is going to occur. During the day , however, melatonin levels should be low as we do not want to feel tired. The suppression of melatonin by natural/artificial light is hence intended and called for during the day as it promotes attention , alertness , and mood . (Illustration showing levels of cortisol (stress hormone which makes us stay awake during the day), in blue connected with bluish light emitted by the full moon shown on the left window, and levels of melatonin (relax hormone which makes us sleep at night) in red connected with reddish light emitted by the half-moon shown on the right window. Source: Sleep Science by Emma - The Sleep Company) What happens when we are exposed to light? The exposure of light induces phase shifts of our clock resulting in either direction: a delaying: biological rhythm shifts to a later clock time with light exposure in the evening, or advancing: biological rhythm shifts to an earlier clock time with light exposure in the morning. The use of light therapy to treat circadian rhythm sleep disorders has proven to be a potentially effective treatment . In one study, the authors examined whether 30 min blue-light pulses are effective in shifting sleep with preservation of sleep integrity and performance in a home-setting light therapy study. The authors found that: blue-light therapy was able to support a sleep phase by increasing a shift in the melatonin rhythm and improving sleep timing. In another study, scientists used a sleep mask to provide a train of light pulses of 2-second duration every 30 seconds through closed eyelids. They found that: blue light pulses given early in the sleep episode impacted the melatonin secretion and significantly delayed circadian phases in older adults thereby, adjusting circadian phase in a home setting. Recommendations by the experts at Emma: If we use ligh correctly, it can positively enrich our sleep as well as our performance and well-being during the day. We recommend starting the day with as much sunlight as possible and avoiding blue light in the evening. This may help to get (back) in sync with your own circadian rhythm. Blue Light Exposure to blue light, emitted by the screens of TV, tablets, computer, mobiles etc., can adversely impact sleeping behaviour and sleep continuity by inhibiting melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone. A study conducted at Harvard University revealed that blue light suppresses the production of melatonin for twice as long as does green light. Hence, although the exposure of blue light during the day will help us to stay alert by suppressing melatonin, exposure in the evening / at night can be detrimental to sleep quality. Cajochen et al., also showed that evening expsoure to blue light lead to suppression of melatonin release more than green light, thereby, offsetting the carcidian rhythm (our internal sleep-wake pattern of approx. 24h, cf. card on Circadian Rhythm) and reducing sleepiness. Blue light exposure also elevated the core body temperature (however, a drop in core body temperature helps us to fall asleep and maintain sleep) and heart rate (which also lowers when we calm down and fall asleep). A study showed that participants who read an e-book before bedtime took an average of nearly 10 min longer to fall asleep compared to individuals who read a printed book. Reading an e-book before bedtime also led to: reduced melatonin release, decreased sleepiness before bedtime, significantly less REM sleep (stage of sleep where most dreaming occurs, cf. card on REM Sleep), and increased levels of morning grogginess. Recommendations by the experts at Emma We recommend keeping the bedroom free from electronic devices such as Iphones and tablets. If their use is absolutely essential before bedtime, then filter apps that block blue-light should be installed and used to reduce exposure to artificial light as much as possible. Artificial Light What effect does artificial light have? Exposure to artificial light emitted by recent technologies, such as LEDs, computer screens, mobile phones or televisions suppresses melatonin production, delaying its release in the body. This creates a phase delay, which means that the peak of melatonin occurs later than the time it would otherwise, leading to restless sleep and late sleep timings. Exposure to artificial lighting can hence delay the circadian clock resulting in late sleep timing and social jetlag (a discrepancy between biological and social timing), which may ultimately lead to detrimental effects on health, such as depression, cancer, cardiovascular diseases. Persons, shift workers, for example, who are regularly exposed to unusual light-dark cycles, are therefore exposed to sleep disturbances and serious health risks. What effect does natural light have? In contrast, natural light induces the synthesis of melatonin. Exposure to natural light aligns the circadian rhythm to the natural light-dark cycle of the environment, resulting in improved sleep patterns and earlier bedtimes. Human bodies can adjust the production of melatonin according to changes in the light-dark cycle of the environment: the circadian clock adapts to the seasonal variations, naturally shortening (sleeping shorter) during the short summer nights and lengthening (sleeping longer) to align with the long winter nights. A camping weekend in natural light can reset the circadian timing and help alleviate social jetlag that contributes to Monday morning grogginess. Recommendations by the experts at Emma We recommend reducing exposure to artificial light at night since it can offset the body's biological clock and suppress the production of the sleep-induing hormone, melatonin. Additionally, to help the body's internal clock reset we recommend expsoure to natural light in the nature: Take out your camping gear and venture into the wilderness for a weekend!",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Thu Jul 18 18:11:50 UTC 2024
Onboarding,Sleep Science,Sleep Deprivation: Sleep Loss & Sleep Debt,"What happens when you are sleep-deprived? Not getting enough sleep leads to sleep debt , which is the difference between the amount of sleep we get and the amount we need. Consequences Find below some consequences of it: Sleep and obesity Lack of sleep alters levels of hormones that affect appetite and cause metabolic changes that can increase the predisposition to obesity. In fact, individuals who sleep less than 7 hours per night are more likely to have higher average body mass indexes and to develop obesity than those who slept for more than 7 hours. Sleep-Immune crosstalk Lack of sleep will suppress the immune system. In fact, people who sleep six hours or less a night are four times more likely to catch a cold when exposed to the virus, compared to those who sleep more than seven hours a night. Sleep to ward off diseases Inadequate sleep can raise the risk of many diseases including cancer, hypertension, coronary diseases, stroke, depression, and diabetes. Sleep and accidents Drowsy driving has been associated with a shortened lifespan due to high risk of car crashes. Sleeping six hours per night can increase your risk of having a car crash by 33% compared to sleeping seven or eight hours a night. Sleep and memory Without getting the adequate amount of sleep, it is much harder for our brain to absorb, process, and recall new information. Sleep deficits further lead to impaired judgments and poor vigilance and concentration. Sleep and mood Sleep deprivation may lead to irritability, impatience, and moodiness. Sleep abnormalities co-occur with various mental disorders, such as anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression or bipolar disorder. Causes Personal choice Some people don’t realize that the body needs adequate sleep, and prefer staying up late. Illness Illness such as colds and tonsillitis can cause snoring, gagging and frequent waking and effect directly on sleep Sleep disorder This includes sleep apnea, snoring and periodic limb movement disorder can disturb a person´s sleep. Work Jobs that have shifts or frequent travels can disrupt the sleep-wake cycles on a regular basis. Airline crew tends to have erratic sleeping patterns Poor sleep hygiene Drinking coffee or smoking cigarettes close to bedtime habit can stimulate the nervous system and makes you sleepless. The sleeping environment sleeping in an environment such as a room that is too hot or cold, noisy neighbors, and a snoring partner can disrupt your sleep. Medications To treat epilepsy or ADHD, the drugs that are used can cause insomnia. Babies Parents mostly experience sleep deprivation because their babies are frequently waking up in the night for feeding or comfort. Sleep Problems and Disorders Sleep problems or sleep disorders refer to conditions that affect sleep quality, timing, or duration. Sleep problems can be triggered by numerous factors, including psychological (e.g. stress, anxiety, loneliness, high-performance pressure), physiological (e.g. problems breathing or other illnesses), and environmental (e.g. aging, jet lag, ambient temperature, diet). Check our Sleep Problems and Disorders informative folder for more information here .

Watch: video with tips to keep a good sleep hygiene Tips for getting a good night's sleep Rules for improving your sleep What is sleep hygiene? Sleep hygiene is a set of habits you develop to get a good night's sleep on a day-to-day basis. It refers to a set of behavioral and environmental recommendations to help you to achieve your best during the night and Awaken your Best during the day. These recommendations relate to different areas of life and are usually quite straightforward so that they may be tailored to suit individual needs and preferences. How to build better sleeping habits? Build an environment that promotes sleep hygiene . E.g. Block electronic devices from your bedroom or have dimmable light. Set routines so the behavior/sleep hygiene measurements feel automatic within the time. Habits can solidify through repetition until we perform them almost automatically, so you don't have to force yourself every day whether you should stick to them. Set a fixed bedtime, turn off your mobile phone 2 hours before going to bed every evening. Make the new routines enjoyable . E.g. spoil yourself with a special bath for your warm bathing in the evening. The experience of enjoyable moments prompts your brain to release dopamine, a hormone involved in the regulation of emotion, motivation, and movement, which strengthens the habit even more. Train your habits as a muscle. Some adjustments may take a great deal of willpower and self-control . But the good news is will power can be strengthened over time. Find your perfect formula. Ideal sleep hygiene varies among individuals , we should test out various adjustments to find out what suits us best. Do not put yourself too much pressure . (Especially when it comes to calming down or falling asleep!) and do not try to implement each recommendation at once! This could most likely lead to unrealistic expectations, disappointment, and discouragement. Small steps are a good start , and you can go from there! Watch: video with tips to keep a good sleep hygiene Tips for getting a good night's sleep Stick to a Sleep schedule Exercise at least ~30 min/day but not later than 2-3 hours before bedtime Avoid caffeine (coffee, cola, black/green tea, chocolate) and nicotine Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed Avoid large or heavy meals and drinks late in the evening Avoid (if possible) medicines that delay or disrupt your natural sleep pattern Do not take naps after 3pm Give yourself time to relax and calm down before going to bed (not by watching TV!) Take a hot bath, cuddle with your beloved or make yourself comfortable in a fluffy, warm blanket before bed Keep your bedroom dark, col and free from any phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, and the like Have the right sunlight exposure in the morning Do not lie in bed awake Last but not least: Invest in a comfortable, high-quality mattress, pillow, and bed linen!!

Onboarding,Sleep Science,The Sleep Architecture: Sleep Stages & Sleep cycles,"Table of Contents How is our sleep structured? What happens at each stage of sleep? N1 N2 Sleep Spindles K Complexes N3 REM How is our sleep structured? The way sleep is structured is referred to as Sleep Architecture . Sleep is composed of a series of so-called sleep cycles . A sleep cycle is composed of 4 sleep stages , which are divided into non-REM (N1, N2, N3) and REM sleep (REM = Rapid Eye Movement) These 4 stages make up one sleep cycle, which takes around 90 minutes to complete. Each stage of sleep has its own unique purpose fulfilling a distinct physiological and psychological function and they occur in the same sequence. Adults need 5 sleep cycles per night, which takes up to 7- 8 hours. Curious about How much sleep do we need at what age? Check out our article for more info here . What happens at each stage of sleep? N1 The phase that transitions from wakefulness to sleep. Begins within minutes of lying down, but can take longer depending on sleep habits, disturbances, sleep disorders, and each person's physiology. The duration can vary between 1 - 7 minutes. Physiological changes Eyes close Muscles relax Core body temperature decreases Your pineal gland begins to release the sleep-inducing hormone: melatonin Your brain waves shift from alpha waves of relaxation to theta waves of sleep You may start dreaming during this stage Curiosity facts: Some people may lose their sense of time and place during this phase. We may not even know we are still asleep. Quite easy to be disturbed during this stage. Hypnic jerks: sudden contractions of the muscle that can wake us up (sense of falling or ripping) - considered normal though they can be worsened by caffeine, stress, or some medications. The difficulty of entering the n1 stage is a common symptom of Insomnia. N2 Half of the four cycles of sleep are spent in this stage. The body starts preparing for deep sleep. Though the stage is similar to the n1 stage, there are some key changes that occur: Physiological changes Eye movement stops Reduced awareness of the environment Lower heart rate and body temperature Your muscles will tense and relax Your upper airway muscles relax Sleep spindles start K complexes Sleep Spindles Are 1 to 2 seconds of bursts of activity, results from interactions between the thalamic and cortical neurons: Neurons from the thalamus (center of the brain) & Neurons from the cortex (top of the brain) start to interact with one another to create these spindles: The Sleep Spindles are essential for forming memories , remembering dreams , and helping transfer short-term to long-term memories . K Complexes are brain waves generated in the cortex that last more than half-second, can be seen on an EGG (electroencephalogram). K complexes help us process information, meaning memory consolidation. Help also to synchronize the sleep stages. They're believed to help us sleep by preventing us from waking up to non-threatening external stimuli, however too much time in this phase isn't a good thing. It can indicate a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or insomnia. Sleep spindle and K-complex waves comparison in an EGG (electroencephalogram): N3 Essential phase to body recovery and is the most restorative of the sleep stages. Help with the growth and repair of bones, muscles, and tissues. It is essential for the immune system. It starts usually 40 minutes after sleep. Physiological changes Your body releases hormones that help with appetite control Blood flow to the brain decreases While blood flow to your muscles increases which gives them oxygen and restorative nutrients Your blood pressure and heart rate decreases even further Memories continue to be consolidating Breathing becomes slower Sleep spindle activity decreases It is the last non-rem stage and is commonly referred to as Slow Wave Sleep . This is a deep stage of sleep and it's difficult to be woken up during this time. If you woke up during this stage you may feel groggy and the mental performance will be slower for about 30 minutes due to the reduced cerebral blood flow during this stage. REM Last stage of the sleep cycle During REM, the pons turns off signals to neurons in the spine, preventing us from acting out our vivid dreams. Emotion processing and consolidation heal emotional wounds problem-solving skills creativity Physiological changes Paralysis of the muscles Rapid and random eye movements Fluctuation in breathing Circulation and body temperature unique to REM sleep Vivid dreams Mind is active Brain waves are similar to those when awake Failure to achieve REM sleep can lead to: Fatigue and cognitive impairment Reduced immunity Impaired hormone production Changes in metabolism High risk of neurological disorders like dementia An inefficient sleep cycle can actually lead to the same consequences of sleep deprivation including: Reduced concentration or hand-eye coordination Daytime sleepiness Irritability Sleep should always be sufficient and efficient .

Onboarding,Sleep Science,The True Importance of Sleep,"Everybody does it. It’s perfectly natural. Some do it naked and some do it with their clothes on. Some do it in a bed, and some do it wherever it pleases them. Yes, that’s right we’re talking about sleep. What is sleep? Sleep is one of the fundamental pillars of a happy and healthy life, along with nutrition and exercise. It is the key to maintaining a healthy mind, body, and soul. Below are some of sleep’s great benefits and some reasons why you shouldn’t skip out on it. What are sleep’s effects on the immune system? Missing out on sleep can have some serious adverse effects on your immune system. Without enough sleep, your body produces fewer cytokines. These are types of proteins that prevent infection and inflammation. They are produced and released during sleep, providing a double dose of protection when you’re getting a bit of shuteye. If your sleep schedule is interrupted by a busy workweek or for any other reason, you should try to stock up on naps. Taking two naps that are no longer than 29 minutes each (according to NASA) has been shown to drastically offset the effects that sleep deprivation has on the immune system. Want a healthier heart? Sleep is essential for a healthy heart. People who don’t get enough sleep are at a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease – regardless of age, weight, smoking, or exercise habits. It is not abundantly clear why sleep is linked to a healthier heart. However, studies suggest that lack of sleep causes disruptions in underlying health conditions and biological processes like glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and inflammation. One of the reasons we know how vital sleep is to the heart is that people with sleep apnea (which causes them to wake frequently during the night) are 58% more likely to develop congestive heart failure. Sleep and mental health According to Harvard Health, sleep and mental health are very much intertwined. Those who suffer from mental health issues are more likely to also suffer from insomnia or other sleep disorders. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared to only 10% to 18% of adults in the general population. Studies using different methods and populations estimate that 65% to 90% of adult patients with major depression, and about 90% of children with the disorder, experience some kind of sleep problem. Weight gain/loss It’s no secret that sleeping is vital to your overall physical health. However, studies have shown the links between getting adequate sleep and healthy weight loss. According to research conducted by the Annals of Internal Medicine, having adequate sleep (7+ hours per night) can lead to significant fat loss. Furthermore, those that get less than 7 hours of sleep will experience 55% less fat loss than those who don’t get their nightly dose of shuteye. Also, those who are sleep-deprived will face significantly less satisfaction after meals and lack the energy to exercise. So keep up your sleeping game while dieting! Concentration/ productivity Good quality sleep is the key to good brain function. While you sleep, your brain is working hard to consolidate memories and what you´ve learned throughout the day. It is also the time that your brain removes waste products from the brain cells enabling you to think more clearly during the day. In the brain of an individual who sleeps normally, the brain will show normal metabolism and blood flow to multiple areas of the brain. Without the proper amount of blood flow, the brain will have difficulty focusing, increased forgetfulness, lack of concentration, decreased problem-solving capabilities, short attention span, and learning difficulties. Remember that quantity and quality of sleep can have a major impact on your health and well-being!",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/onboarding/sleep-science,Fri Sep 27 12:36:47 UTC 2024

Operations,Case Handling,Email structure and format - Guidelines,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction and disclaimer Email contacts structure breakdown 1. Initial greeting 2. Issue acknowledgement 3. Resolution 4. Closing statement 5. Signature Spacing Engagement opportunities Things to avoid Introduction and disclaimer This article is meant to act as a guideline on what we expect an email communication from Emma should look like. However, it is not meant to be seen as a set of restraints, but rather a platform on which agents can build upon. Like with a phone call, our main goal will always be to have our emails come as close as possible to an actual conversation between two human beings . Hence, why allowing agents to find their voice and be naturally empathic is so important. We want contacts to be fluid and personalized. Emma is a very agile company, so the agents representing it should never be (or sound) rigid. Note: Always make sure to verify if there are other email addresses on CC or on the ""To"" list outside of the validated customer email and remove any additional emails. Contact history should also be verified , as the customer will receive all the history, make sure there are no crossed emails or information the customer should not be receiving This article is only applicable for email ticket contacts. Email contacts structure breakdown The five major dividers in an email contact are: 1. Initial greeting * The contact opening * Guidelines: This part of the email should be used to greet the customer and to thank them for reaching out to us. However, it is important to always adapt this to match the circumstances. We shouldn’t be rigid here as there is a lot of room for personalization and creativity, but we must make sure that our tone matches the customer’s situation. Notes: Agents shouldn’t use the same “thank you” statement during an email back-and-forth with a customer. This sentence should always be different. Examples: “Thank you for letting us know how to proceed.” (When the customer gets back to us with a decision on a pending issue.) “Thank you for sending us the information we had requested.” (When the customer has provided us with pictures or additional information as per our request.) “Thank you for your patience.” (When the customer was waiting for us to follow-up on something.) 2. Issue acknowledgement * Context and empathy * Guidelines: This part of the email is meant to acknowledge the situation the customer is experiencing. If this situation is negative, this is where we can show empathy towards the customer. Additionally, this is also where we start showing the customer that we are here to help, and we will. Commiting to help will always put a positive spin on our support. Customers need to be made aware that whatever their problem is, we will make it right. In specific circumstances, this section can also be used to offer an initial apology. Example: “We are very sorry to hear that you have not been able to adapt to your new Emma mattress, and we sincerely apologise for not living up to your expectations on this occasion.” Notes: Agents should be aware that this is not a rephrasing exercise, emails are not phone calls. Agents should always write as if they are speaking for Emma, as such, they should always use the pronoun “We”. 3. Resolution * Providing/framing the resolution * Guidelines: This is probably the most important part of our emails. In the eye of the customer, if this part fails, everything else becomes almost irrelevant. In this section we provide or request information, we explain what happened, clarify doubts, and we educate the customer on our procedures. Additionally, whenever applicable and possible, we should set expectations regarding deadlines. Agents should be clear, use positive language and try to be as concise as possible. Personalization is always required. Our email replies should always be tailored to the situation at hand. Notes: Agents should make sure to break down a reply that addresses multiple issues into multiple paragraphs. Customers will feel lost in a big wall of text. All information provided should be relevant to the customer and the situation at hand. If the query is unclear, agents should not be afraid to question the customer so that they can understand the actual issue before offering a solution. However, in certain situations, this may not be necessary. Ex: If a customer contacts us about our “100 night warranty” on product X, we do not need to ask for clarification. Instead, we can just inform the customer that this product comes with a 50/100/200 night trial period and 2/5/10-year warranty. If we can clearly solve something in the first contact, without leaving loose ends, we should try to do it. 4. Closing statement * Availability and farewell * Guidelines: This part of the email should be used to wrap up the contact in a nice and positive way. Thanking the customer for contacting us, for their patience during a lengthy process or for their cooperation in situations where we asked for pictures, for example. Additionally, this is also the part of the email where we leave the door open for future contacts by showing our availability to assist further should the need arises. If the situation calls for it, we can also use this part to show empathy again. However, this will always depend on the context. Added value: If the agent feels this would be a good fit for the case at hand, a positive closing statement like “Have a nice day/Have a great weekend” can be added at the end of the closing statement section. Once again, this sort of statement is always dependent on a favourable context. 5. Signature * Structure and format * Signature rules: The signature should always start with a polite ending to the email. “Best/kind regards” are the most common options but, depending on the situation, this can be personalized by the agent. However, please always make sure that more creative expressions, like “Sleep happy”, are not used in situations where the customer is aggrieved and may take this the wrong way. Then, below the valediction, should come the agent’s name. This should only include the first name. If there is more than one agent with that specific first name, then the agents should include the initial of their last name (followed by a period) as well in their signature (ex: “Paul D.”). Notes: There should be no reference to the Contact Center partner in the signature. For Trustpilot reviews: since we don't have the Emma logo available, agents should sign ""Paul from your Emma team"". Spacing * The problem with visual noise * What is the issue? Structuring our email properly, by itself, does not guarantee that our message will get through to our customers. In modern days, we must always be aware that our customers’ attention span is very short. Having an email reply where all the information is cluttered in a large wall of text will undoubtedly cause frustration on the customers’ side, as this will prevent quick and easy access to the information. This can lead to misunderstandings and customers acting against or instructions. In extreme cases, this can even prompt the customer to give up entirely in trying to decipher our reply and just contact us again for further clarification, which will prevent us from handling this contact efficiently and add unnecessary workload onto our teams. As such, in order to be effective, we need to make sure that we are being clear and precise in the information we are providing in writing but also that we are presenting said information in a way that is as free as possible of visual noise. How do we tackle this? By spacing our email sections properly, we are effectively reducing visual noise and making sure our message has a bigger chance of being successfully received by its recipient. Why do we leave two blank lines before the signature? Like with a normal letter, the signature on an email should be further detached from the email body. This is more professional and reinforces the notion that we are fully committed to a high standard of service. ​ ​ Engagement opportunities * Making connections * Opportunities: Agents should always make sure to adapt to the customer . Although our approach should be informal and fluid, if we encounter a customer that doesn’t respond well to this, we should change our approach to suit that customer’s needs (Ex: A customer that wants to be addressed as “Mr. Smith”, instead of “John”). Research has shown that messages that fit with a customer’s attitudes and dispositional motives are processed more fluently and evaluated more positively than incongruent messages. Always look one step ahead . Customer interactions unfold like a chess match. If we know a certain action on our end will cause a reaction on the customer’s side, agents should make sure to take that into account when planning their next steps. Providing context and explaining why things are how they are, will always go a long way. Transparency is key, if we want our customers to trust us. If a customer is excited about a product or a resolution, we should try to match their energy in our responses. Using appropriate punctuation marks and choosing the right words will be fundamental throughout the contact. If the customer is using emojis and the context is favourable, or the situation was resolved with a positive outcome for the customer, agents can, in moderation, use emojis as well . This will act as positive reinforcement for the interaction and will enhance the connection between customer and agent. When using emojis, if, by default, the platform does not allow for full, colourful emojis during text entry, type Windows logo key + . (period). The emoji keyboard will appear. Things to avoid * Communication quicksand * Things to avoid: Agents should always make sure to spell the customer’s name correctly . This is a huge red flag and will immediately convey a poor image of our service standards. Customers should always be treated with respect. Avoid repetition . Starting most sentences using the same words (Ex: We... We... We...) or using the same expressions multiple times (Ex: Please note... Please note...) will just reinforce the negative bias, many customers have nowadays, that CS agents are just copy/pasting templates. When something goes wrong, focus on the solution, not on who is to blame for an issue . We are one team, we should all be pulling in the same direction. Do not use unnecessary branding . It is fine to refer to products using our brand name (Ex: “Emma One mattress”). However, we should not be overusing the brand name on written communication. Negative reinforcement should be avoided at all costs . Acknowledging that something did not go according to plan is one thing, reinforcing the negative aspect of a customer’s experience with us is another altogether. Always try to focus positively on the solution and what we will now do for the customer. Information should be consistent. Agents should not provide conflicting instructions or guidelines to a customer. When asking for additional information from a customer, agents should always make sure they request everything they need at once . If we have to ask the customer for more information/pictures afterwards, this will just cause frustration and create the belief that we are artificially blocking their path towards a solution. pdf EMMA - Email structure and format - v1.1.pdf 2.05 MB",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/operations/case-handling,Tue Nov 18 11:19:47 UTC 2025
Operations,Case Handling,First Contact Resolution Guidelines,"Introduction In our effort to enhance the customer experience, we aim to ensure that our communications with customers are as effective as possible. Topics that are First Contact Resolution (FCR) oriented should be addressed and resolved as completely as possible to minimize the need for customers to engage with customer support beyond what is necessary. Agents should always strive to close cases in the first interaction whenever possible. Below, you will find a set of guidelines designed to help ensure effective First Contact Resolution: Note: Only applicable for the markets: UK; PT; ES FCR Guidelines Active Reading & Understanding: Carefully read and acknowledge the customer’s concern. Ensure the resolution fully addresses the issue instead of providing a generic response. Clear & Concise Communication: Avoid vague responses. Provide a clear, step-by-step explanation or resolution. If needed, include screenshots, links, or additional instructions. Proactive Assistance: Anticipate possible follow-up questions and address them in the initial response. Offer guidance on next steps, expected resolution times, or alternative solutions. Consistency in Information: Ensure all details align with internal guidelines, policies, and previous communications to avoid conflicting responses. Status of Ticket: Use ""Internal Hold"" when awaiting confirmation from a third party (e.g., carrier, refunds team, OM, or Performance Manager). Otherwise, cases should be marked as ""Pending Confirmation Resolution"" after the first reply. ​ Non-FCR Guidelines Information to Include in the First Reply: Even if a case cannot be closed immediately, the first response should be as complete as possible. Follow the FCR guidelines to provide clear, relevant, and complete information, reducing unnecessary back-and-forth. Awaiting Response: Only use this when additional information is required from the customer (e.g., bank details, damage pictures, address confirmation). Do not use it simply to wait for the customer to confirm resolution—if all necessary support has been provided, set the case as ""Pending Confirmation Resolution."" Internal Hold: Use this when awaiting confirmation from a third party (e.g., carrier, refunds team, OM, or Performance Manager). ​ Follow-Up & Resolution Timeframes Follow Up if Needed: If an issue requires additional steps (e.g., waiting for confirmation from another department), it should be tagged as Internal Hold. Follow-ups Every 3 Days: Cases in Internal Hold should be checked and updated at least every three days. Escalation After 7 Days: If no resolution is reached within a week, escalate the case to the Performance Manager. ​ Best Practices Use Standardized Templates, but Personalize: Stick to structured responses to maintain consistency, but ensure each reply is personalized to the customer’s specific issue. Check Customer History: Before responding, check if the customer has previously contacted us about the same issue to avoid redundant or conflicting resolutions. Avoid Unnecessary Transfers or Escalations: Ensure agents have the necessary tools and knowledge to resolve as many cases as possible without escalating. Train Agents on Product & Process Knowledge: Regular training sessions should be conducted to improve efficiency. Use Categories Correctly: Properly categorize tickets to track trends and identify areas for improvement.

Operations,Case Handling,System notes guidelines,"In this article you will find the guidelines on how to properly leave notes in our tools: Magento, Fluent Commerce and Sprinklr. ​ Keywords How to leave notes; Notes on Sprinklr; Notes on FluentCommerce; Notes on Magento; System Notes; Notes guidelines TABLE OF CONTENTS ​ Why are the Notes important? ​ ​ General Notes guidelines ​ Notes in the Order Management Systems ​ Magento ​ FluentCommerce ​ Notes on Sprinkr Why are the internal notes so important? Internal notes are essential to ensure that we keep track of our customers contacts, requests and also of Emmies' actions, especially when these are connected to an order. By checking the notes done after a contact, one should be able to easily get an understanding of the customer's request, so that an accurate follow-up can be done. Notes allow us to know if a contact was compliant with legal requirements such as GDPR authentication , and help us understand what the customer's contact reason was, what steps have been taken to assist said customer and what is still pending action on our side or theirs. It is also through notes that our different teams at Emma, such as Product Quality or Logistic teams, can gain a quick and detailed understanding of a claim that was raised by a customer. With that in mind, and since Emma is a truly multicultural company, it is of utter importance that all notes are created in English , so that anyone, from any team, can easily assimilate the information included in these notes, without the need for translation (that would create a serious risk of miscommunication). As such, agents should also refrain from using abreviations , as these might not be understood by other agents or other POCs. ​ General notes guidelines Make sure to follow the templates mentioned on this article at all times when leaving notes; Be accurate and concise, inserting all relevant information in the notes but avoiding irrelevant or redundant things; Do not leave important information out: if you promised the customer a refund for X amount or if there's a new deadling for the parcel's delivery, this information should be present in the notes; Stick to the facts: your personal opinions on the customer should not be present in internal notes; And, finally, always insert notes in English. Notes in an order management system (OMS) ​ These notes are mandatory while handling tickets that involve existing orders, and should always be inserted in the original order . T he only exception being Fluent Commerce supplement orders that were created from a Magento order, in those circumstances, the OMS notes should be left on the supplement order in Fluent Commerce. Template to be used to insert notes in Magento: ​ GDPR: Y/N (""Y"" if the customer was authenticated, or didn't require authentication / ""N"" if the customer was not successfully authenticated) TN: ____________________ (Sprinklr Ticket Number) ENQ: __________________ (Enquiry) ACT: __________________ (Actions taken and any Sprinklr flow errors encountered) Template to be used to insert notes in FluentCommerce: AGT: ___________________ (Agent's username, as shown on Sprinklr) GDPR: Y/N (""Y"" if the customer was authenticated, or didn't require authentication / ""N"" if the customer was not successfully authenticated) TN: ____________________ (Sprinklr Ticket Number) ENQ: __________________ (Enquiry) ACT: __________________ (Actions taken and any Sprinklr flow errors encountered) ** Additionally, please note that FluentCommerce order notes currently have a 200 characters limitation. As such, if the agent requires more than 1 entry to leave complete notes, these should be divided into PT1 (part 1), PT2 (part 2), etc. IMPORTANT: When contacted by a third party, after the original customer has been authenticated, and the contact has proceeded with said third party, the notes on Magento / Fluent Commerce should reflect this fact. These notes should mention the original customer authentication and the fact that we then proceeded with the contact with said third party in question, noting down this person's name. Notes on Sprinklr Note: All internal notes on Sprinklr MUST BE added using the the ""Profile Collaboration"" section. Please check this article that explains the right process for leaving notes on Sprinklr. ​ Leaving notes on Sprinklr on the ""Profile Collaboration"" is MANDATORY in the following scenarios: ​ 1) Escalations, when escalating cases to other related teams (ex: Emma Internals, Supervisors, etc.). ​ TN: _______________ (Sprinklr Ticket number) ON: ______________ (Order Number) POC: ______________ (Person with whom matter was escalated with) ENQ: _____________ (Enquiry) ACT: ______________ (Actions taken) JIRA: ______________ (JIRA ticket number, if applicable) ​ High-Level Escalations This should be used when replying to the high-level escalation (HLE) ticket only.

Operations,Others,2024 Public Contact Guidelines,"T his article is only applicable for contacts made through public messages on Facebook, Instagram, Trustpilot and Yotpo. ​ Introduction and disclaimer This article is meant to act as a guideline on what we expect a reply to a public social media contact with Emma to look like. However, it is not meant to be seen as a set of restraints, but rather a platform on which agents can build upon. Our main goal will always be to have our contacts come as close as possible to an actual conversation between two human beings. Hence, why allowing agents to find their voice and be naturally empathic is so important. We want contacts to be fluid and personalized. Emma is a very agile company, so the agents representing us should never be (or sound) rigid. As Emma representatives, we want to show that we are humans, and humans are not perfect. We always acknowledge the complicated bits, so we can honestly and authentically give solutions. ​ Public contacts structure breakdown The four major dividers in a public contact are: Identifying the level of escalation Initial greeting and acknowledgement Resolution Closure Identifying the level of escalation Opening the contact and understanding the issue* Note : the levels of escalation are applicable to 1–2-star reviews. According to the user research, consumers use reviews to assess how well the company handles customer inquiries or concerns to gauge overall user experience and satisfaction. They look for the reviews that articulate the effectiveness of the company's unique selling propositions (USPs), including adherence to return policies, adept problem-solving and the efficiency of cashback processes. When publicly contacting the customer, we establish indicators of our service quality. Not only we try to create a positive experience for the reviewer, but also showcasing our authenticity and reliability for the rest of the consumers. We know that some cases are more concerning than others, and some customers might be more sensitive depending on their issue. Some of them might have tried to solve their issue with us several times and couldn’t, causing a lot of frustration. Some might have even contacted a lawyer to take legal action against us. And others might be frustrated with the product they received. All cases are important and should be treated as such. But depending on the level, we should take different actions and reply in different ways. Here is a quick way to identify the levels of escalation: Level 1 – Mild Frustration / Disappointment Level 2 – High Frustration / Anger Level 3 – Extreme Frustration / Outrage What is this level of escalation? Mild complaints about product or service quality where we can still turn it into a neutral/positive experience with the right reply and action. High levels of frustration, more damaging to our reputation and need to be sent faster to internal handling. Possibly longer complaints with more than one paragraph, use of caps lock, and mentions of other unsuccessful attempts of contact. Highest level of frustration that can possibly lead to serious company damage. Possibly longer complaints with more than one paragraph, use of caps lock, and mentions of other unsuccessful attempts of contact. Specific alarming keywords are used that can give us a hint that the customer will take some action against the company. How to identify the level of escalation? If any of these words are used: ""musty smell"", ""sagging mattress"", ""disappointed"", ""uncomfortable"", ""discomfort"", ""generic excuses"" If any of these words are used: ""nightmare”, ""joke"", ""appalling"", ""terrible"", ""laughable"", “unethical”, “shocking”, “disgusting”, ""shocking service"", ""awful company"", ""absolute shambles,"" ""incompetence” If any of these words are used: ""legal advice"", ""lawyer”, “fraud”, “scam”, “illegal”, “bankrupt” After identifying the customer's level, you can now act accordingly following the next steps. To show contrition and empathy, our tone shifts from more lighthearted to more apologetic as we move up the customer frustration levels. Our responses will also be lengthier at each stage, so that we can give customers the required information. The following templates provide a guide for tone and content, but agents should bring their own personality to their responses, as this will be more sincere and thoughtful. Agents are, however, welcome to mix and match the responses (always checking that the grammar is correct once they combine responses). ​ 2. Initial greeting and acknowledgement Being empathetic and getting the context* Note : always greet the customer; by the first name, unless the customer's username on the platform is a nickname. In those circumstances just use a generic greeting without using any name. Negative Sentiment Level 1 – Mild Frustration / Disappointment Negative Sentiment Level 2 – High Frustration / Anger Negative Sentiment Level 3 – Extreme Frustration / Outrage Direction At level 1, although the customer is annoyed, we can still showcase a bit of personality while acknowledging our shortcomings. This can help to ease the tension and build goodwill. Blue bracket : Summarise what the issue is. Green bracket: Offering a lighthearted observation. This can be about sleep (check our recent comms for more insights), contextual, or general. At level 2, we should apologize and show empathy and understanding by acknowledging the customer’s frustrations. Blue bracket: Summarise what the issue is. Green bracket: Paraphrasing the customer’s main pain points e.g. frustration, time consuming, hassle. At level 3, the important thing is to apologize sincerely and assure the customer that their issue is of the highest priority and is being treated as such. Green bracket: Paraphrasing the customer’s main pain points e.g. frustration, time consuming, hassle. Purple bracket: Assuring the customer that you’re dealing with the issue personally.

Operations,Others,Empathy Statement,"As you could see in our articles, more than selling our products, we want to build relationships and create connections with our customers, and for that Empathy is the must-have skill for our customer service. Maintaining positive fulfilling relationships means going beyond basic communication and polite thank-yous. And for that, we must feel e mpowered in our front line, able to address situations at hand and create positive and memorable experiences for each customer that is reaching us. But how? By putting Empathy into practice. Turn on your sensitivity radar, and start reading and understanding the customer who is on the other side of the ticket. Take your chance to create moments that will increase customers' emotional attachment to us. And as a first step you should have in mind is that every ticket you receive has a person on the other side that needs your help , feeling emotions that you may have the power to connect with and make them feel better. You hold the power to transform the interaction into an opportunity to make an impact. Understanding Customers Whenever you touch a case, you need to make it human. Question yourself: Who is this customer and what is his/her emotional statement? By identifying the customer you are interacting with, you can be prepared to deal with their behaviors and anticipate their needs, providing a personalized customer experience. To put into practice, let's simplify and divide our customers into 3 main categories, based on our customer's journeys and our main contact reasons: Now, let's list some possible feelings customers under the above situation may have: When you look at the person on the other side of the ticket and try to understand the feelings they have, you more than actively & sincerely listen to the person, you are also touching the human side of the conversation and by that, being able to empathize with it . Example: when someone is uncertain , as they are not sure if the order will arrive in time, or maybe afraid the wrong decision was made by choosing Emma, or even worried if the money was a bad investment and the product will not arrive, question yourself: how can you make this person feels better? What are the feelings that could transform this experience with us? Maybe making this person feel valuable to us, showing how glad we are for trusting our company. Assure we will deliver our promises and in case there is an issue we are facing, give the confidence we will find a solution as we value their experience with us. That is much more than just updating order status, is giving people an appropriate and engaging emotional experience . Possible opportunities: To build relationships, empathy is key. It's how we make bad situations good, and good situations great. We are excited about a customer checking out our products, showing joy over a purchase decision, and stating anticipation of the soon-to-come good night sleep on the new Emma mattress. Take into consideration that at Emma, we recognize our mistakes, and apologize when needed - but we use empathy statements as the main positive human touch by reinforcing and appreciating the customer's decision for choosing Emma. Turn on your sensitivity to read our customers, take the best of the interaction and you will feel empowered. Take this ownership and put your human touch in place. Take the chance to make an impact and make our customer service interaction a better place. :) Down load the complete version of the example above bellow.

Operations,Others,Gained Understanding & Asked the right questions,"Table of Content Active Listening Effective Questioning Investigating the information When a customer is contacting us, it is essential we understand the reason for the contact in order to provide a resolution. This article will help you to understand what is the best way to open a conversation with a customer and from that, take the proper direction to make an impact on the customer situation. Let's think in a practical way: With the right question in place, you can deflect a return and turn it into an upselling opportunity. Customers may not be aware of the variables that could be influencing their experiences, or what could be the right pillow to fit their needs. That's where our expertise comes in place, but for that: we need to listen to our customers . But, what is the difference between hearing and listening? Hearing is a passive act. It's about perceiving audible sounds with your ear. Listening , on the other hand, is trying to understand what the other person is saying and feeling. Active Listening Active listening is sincere listening, attentive and open. Able to reflect the content of the teller, able to reflect the feeling of the teller. We have different behaviors that you can demonstrate active listening that are essential for the customer, such as verbal nods, taking notes, asking questions, paraphrasing, and summarizing. By active listening, you will make customers more confident that you are there available, and willing to help. Plus, support you to avoid misunderstandings and mistakes, providing accurate and efficient resolution. Effective Questioning But let's say the customer is not providing enough information, or you may need to confirm if you understood what happened with the order of the customer. There are different styles of questions that can help you to guide the conversations. Techniques that can help you to control the conversation, they are the Open and closed questions, reflective or confirming and the probing questions. When putting into practice, the idea is for you to imagine your questions as a funnel, filtering the details provided by the customer and ending up on your pain point: the topic you need to resolve to make your customer happy. For that, you can always use the funnel technique. Investigating the information With practice, you will notice that sometimes, the problem presented by the customer is not always the root cause of the issue. As one example, the customer may call us saying his delivery is delayed and the root cause of this issue could be different reasons such as the delivery delay from the carrier, or delivery delay from our warehouse partner, or even delay from the warehouse not because of their capacity, but because they are out of stock. All of them require us different teams, and different follow-up actions, so it is crucial to find out the root cause of the problem. That's why every time we are handling a customer inquiry, we need to combine our skills with a proper investigation by checking all available tools & information related to it. Check notes left in the system by previous colleagues (any past contact from the customer/note left by another team - senior agent or logistic team?) Check order-related information (barcode status or related case information available) By doing so, you will be able to provide the proper resolution and make an impact on our customer experience.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/operations/others,Tue Nov 18 11:22:35 UTC 2025
Operations,Others,Leading Interactions Efficiently,"When we look at the customer service business and the metrics we have in place to measure our success, many of them will be related to t ime , mostly defining how efficiently we handle customers' inquiries. But why is time such an important metric for customer service? When you are contacting customer service, how much would you enjoy being transferred to different people to talk about one single issue? Or, how likely would you recommend a service that is not able to provide a response at first, and you would have to call later to have visibility of your order status? How about the experience of being put on hold, and waiting for 10 minutes in the line while you have no idea about what is happening on the other side of the line? Time defines your experience with the service you receive. But on the other hand, the question you should have to yourself when having a CS experience should be: Was your contact handled fast and efficiently? Did you get the answers you were looking for? Were you able to learn where to find information and avoid a returning contact for it? Was your time respected while interacting with the customer service? Those are some rules we should take into consideration while handling customer interactions: 1. Educate the customer whenever possible, educate the customer on any available channel we may have to avoid a returning call , for example, educate him to find proper answers in our Frequently Asked Questions, email or account, whenever the information is available. Empower our customers to self portal and have no reasons to invest the time calling us back. 2 . Antecipate procedures If the customer will need to send us a picture, provide already the next step indications, right directions, email needed, or information up-front. Anticipate needs by respecting their time. This will directly impact their experience with us. 3. Do not postpone information Do not avoid conflict or negative messages. Transparency is part of our DNA and avoidinh pr this will may manage bad customer expectations and take more time to an honest and necessary outcome. 4. Do not escalate cases when the workflow is clear Escalation usually has more negative impacts than positive ones. It shows a lack of decision and ownership of our frontline, open procedures and by the end, pushes decisions that usually are already in place. Be careful with customer expectations and the time you take to provide an answer to the customer's inquiries. 5. Hold etiquette Ensure the c ustomer agrees to wait in the line while you put them on hold in a phone interaction, or be clear you will take some internal steps while live chatting with the customer. Always thank the customer when returning, showing appreciation for the time waiting . 6. Closure question Always ensure there is no open question from the customer: ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" Closure questions guide the customer through their needs and avoid a returning contact from the customer as you are already ready to support this customer with you. 7. Respect Closing time Respect customer time until the end of the interaction, ensure the customer takes enough time to end up the call by not rushing it to the end and negatively impacting the customer's experience with us. The closure should always focus on a positive feeling, as the customer will be motivated to reply positively to a Csat survey that may come after it.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/operations/others,Tue Nov 18 11:22:35 UTC 2025

Notes: Customers should not be holding for more than 2 minutes without the agent getting back to them. If the agent feels the situation will take a long time to investigate, the customer should be informed of this and given the option of receiving a follow-up contact later in the day. Key words: investigative, analytical and diligent. 4. Solution * Providing a resolution * On a phone call At this stage of the contact, the agent should: Thank the customer for holding while we looked into his query; Clarify what happened and (if possible and applicable) why it happened; Inform what was done on our end and what the next steps are; Set expectations regarding timelines (when applicable); Educate the customer on our processes and procedures (when applicable), in order to avoid repeated contacts for issues the customer could have tackled by himself/herself. On a chat contact At this stage of the contact, the agent should: Thank the customer for holding while we looked into his query; Clarify what happened and (if possible and applicable) why it happened; Inform what was done on our end and what the next steps are; Set expectations regarding timelines (when applicable); Educate the customer on our processes and procedures (when applicable), in order to avoid repeated contacts for issues the customer could have tackled by himself/herself. Notes: Clarity is key at this stage, everything should be explained thoroughly to the customer and we should make sure evertyhing was understood on his end. Key words: clear, structured and reassuring. 5. Closure * Giving an open-ended farewell * On a phone call At this stage of the contact, the agent should: Offer availability to assist with other queries; Thank the customer for contacting us; Bid the customer farewell in a pleasant way. On a chat contact At this stage of the contact, the agent should: Offer availability to assist with other queries; Thank the customer for contacting us; Bid the customer farewell in a pleasant way. * No signature required. Notes : On a phone call, if the customer is already actively closing the contact, we should not interrupt that to offer availability. We only offer availability to assist with other queries if there is room to do so. Key words: warm, available and polite. Engagement opportunities * Making connections * Opportunities: Agents should always make sure to adapt to the customer . Although our approach should be informal and fluid, if we encounter a customer that doesn’t respond well to this, we should change our approach to suit that customer’s needs (Ex: A customer that wants to be addressed as “Mr. Smith”, instead of “John”). Research has shown that messages that fit with a customer’s attitudes and dispositional motives are processed more fluently and evaluated more positively than incongruent messages. Always look one step ahead. Customer interactions unfold like a chess match. If we know a certain action on our end will cause a reaction on the customer’s side, agents should make sure to take that into account when planning their next steps. Providing context and explaining why things are how they are, will always go a long way. Transparency is key, if we want our customers to trust us. If a customer is excited about a product or a resolution, we should try to match their energy in our responses. On a phone call, intonation is key for this. On a chat, using appropriate punctuation marks and choosing the right words will be fundamental throughout the contact. During a chat, if the customer is using emojis and the context is favourable, or the situation was resolved with a positive outcome for the customer, agents can, in moderation, use emojis as well . This will act as positive reinforcement for the interaction and will enhance the connection between customer and agent. When using emojis, if, by default, the platform does not allow for full, colourful emojis during text entry, type Windows logo key + . (period). The emoji keyboard will appear. Things to avoid * Dodging communication traps * Things to avoid: Agents should always make sure to say and spell the customer’s name correctly . This is a huge red flag and will immediately convey a poor image of our service standards. Customers should always be treated with respect. Avoid repetition . Starting most sentences using the same words (Ex: We... We... We...) or using the same expressions multiple times (Ex: Please note... Please note...) will just reinforce the negative bias, many customers have nowadays, that CS agents are just copy/pasting templates. When something goes wrong, focus on the solution, not on who is to blame for an issue . We are one team, we should all be pulling in the same direction. Do not use unnecessary branding . It is fine to refer to products using our brand name (Ex: “Emma One mattress”). However, we should not be overusing the brand name on spoken or written communication. Negative reinforcement should be avoided at all costs . Acknowledging that something did not go according to plan is one thing, reinforcing the negative aspect of a customer’s experience with us is another altogether. Always try to focus positively on the solution and what we will now do for the customer. Information should be consistent. Agents should not provide conflicting instructions or guidelines to a customer. When asking for additional information from a customer, agents should always make sure they request everything they need at once . If we have to ask the customer for more information/pictures afterwards, this will just cause frustration and create the belief that we are artificially blocking their path towards a solution. What to do when the customer is not replying? * How to proceed with unresponsive customers * If a customer is not replying to us on a chat conversation we will send two messages: 1) After 3 minutes of not receiving a reply or message from our customer, we will send a message saying "" [Insert customer's first name], are you still connected? "". 2) After sending the above message we will wait an additional 2 minutes for the customer to reply. 3) However, if after these 5 minutes (3 + 2) the customer still did not reply, we will send the following message "" Unfortunately, since we have not received any message from you in the last 5 minutes, we will need to close this chat. Nevertheless, if you still need our support, please feel free to reach out to us again via chat or through email: [insert market customer support email address]. Thank you and have a nice day. "" and close the chat. * NOTE : The above is not applicable at the end of a contact, when the agent asks if there is anything else we can assist the customer with. On that occasion, the agent should only wait 2 minutes and, if there is no reply from the customer, they should close the chat without further delay. What to do when the customer is is being disrespectful and/or overly aggressive? * How to proceed with disrespectful customers * If a customer is being disrespectful and/or overly aggressive agents should do the following: 1) After trying to calm the customer down, the agent should provide 1 warning: ""I understand that this situation might be frustrating for you, and I am here to help. However, I must ask that we maintain a respectful tone during this conversation. If you continue to behave this way, I will be forced to terminate this call/chat"". 2) If the customer accepts the agent's advice, the call/chat will continue. If the customer does not, and continues to be disrespectful or overly aggressive the agent should say ""I am sorry, but given what I previously mentioned, I will now terminate this call/chat"". 3) In case the customer contacts again after that and behaves appropriately, the agent that takes the contact should handle it normally. In case the customer continues to behave disrespectfully, the new agent should follow the steps on points 1 and 2. At this point it is recommended that the case/customer is transferred to a Supervisor/Team Lead. pdf EMMA - Live contacts structure - v1.1.pdf 1.29 MB",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/operations/others,Tue Nov 18 13:30:02 UTC 2025

Operations,Others,Transparency (Follow Through),"At Emma, we are honest and direct, and we openly address anything we need to. Transparency is about clearly communicating the course of action of a situation, and with that ensuring the customer is on the same page as you. Every day we are handling requests from customers related to orders. With time, words such as fulfillment , warehouse , barcode , and SKU become natural to our ears. Even the deadline for the order status to change from packing to shipped is quite obvious (when not facing an unexpected issue). But all those general knowledge is not the same for our customers. Perception and Subjectivity Perception is the way we interpret sensory data, but the way we do it, therefore, is subjective. We perceive things differently and we may react differently to situations we face. Subjectivity is how someone's judgment is shaped by personal opinions and feelings instead of outside influences. As one example, the judgment of a ""delay"" or the adjective related to it can be very subjective, as the example below: ""Now that is fixed, the delivery will be fast "". ""Fast"" is subjective information as it can differ based on people's experiences. Plus, ask yourself, how much time means ""fast""? 2 Minutes? 3 Hours? 2 Days? One week? And maybe ask someone else, what does fast means for them? It may happen that people perceive the time differently leading to a misunderstanding, simply because using the word ""fast"" gives no precise information. If you hear someone saying: ""The difference in the price of this pillow is - affordable - "", you may face the same situation. Affordable to one person could be completely different from another. It is just another example of how the wording can impact the way people will perceive information. When handling customers' interaction, it is essential we provide specific deadlines and next steps as this not only gives customer control of the situation and clarity of what is happening, and how is happening, but also avoids a returning contact from the customer for something that could have been clarified before. But how to do it in an effective way? Transparency Framework The transparency framework is a supportive guideline to you manage customer expectations by being specific on what happened (acknowledge & reason) / the possible resolution and outcome of it ( solve ) / The clear next steps with specifics when and how & the following closure, ensuring all information was successfully transmitted with no open questions, in a precise and objective way (close).",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/operations/others,Tue Nov 18 11:22:35 UTC 2025
Operations,Others,"Paypal & Disputes, Claims and Chargebacks","Introduction In this article, you can learn about the payment method of PayPal, about what are the differences between disputes, claims and chargebacks, and how to handle those cases. How to access PayPal Portal? The credentials to access the portal will be shared by managers and/or supervisors with the respective agents who are responsible for those payment tasks. Link: Access: Emma CS - Paypall - User portal General Information PayPal works as an intermediary between customers and their banks. A customer creates an account with the Paypal system adding to it a bank account or credit/debit card and whenever they're making an online payment, they can select which account to debit. All transactions are processed through PayPal, instead of the bank. When selecting Paypal while purchasing with Emma, PayPal proceeds the payment in our system and activates the order; and charges the customer directly via their selected payment method. Paypal cases Situations in which an unhappy customer who purchased with Paypal decides to have their money back will appear to our CS as a case to be handled with specific steps. After logging in to the Portal, the customer service team is responsible for handling cases in the Resolution Center at the portal, which concentrates the list of open cases . Open cases are payment petitions raised by customers to Paypal. After a dispute from the customer, Paypal opens cases for us to ""respond"" to the related claim raised. Our goal is to investigate the case, take a decision about the possible outcome of the claim and reply to the portal in accordance with it. The claims are raised for several reasons such as product not received, product claim, or even an incorrect dispute for the charge raised by the customer. Here you can check the list with types of cases related to PayPal payment that you may need to handle. Below in this article, you will learn about each of them with more details about the process. Types of cases: DISPUTES: It is a pre-claim process that allows the customer to open a dispute for the payment based on 2 reasons: not receiving item or item received is not as described. CLAIMS: Customer is unhappy with the outcome of a dispute and the case was escalated as a claim. CHARGEBACK : Customer or Fraud Victims reporting straight to bank / CC company to report the charges. APPEALS: Emma’s actions towards cases. IMPORTANT - Responding cases When handling a case, have in mind: Paypal is not a customer service portal, and should not lead to conversation or claim escalation. It is a portal dedicated to approving or not disputes and related refunds. Always attach related proof to the answers (proof of delivery, as an example). We are given 20 days to respond to disputes (open case will always have a precise deadline ). If we do not reply to the case on time, the dispute will be processed in favor of customer. We don't give discounts or compensations via PayPal portal. We just approve the refund of canceled or returned items. How to handle Paypal cases? Disputes In this one, PayPal does not intervene. The customer is entitled to open the dispute and it is up to Emma to investigate and provide proof and/or justification. If a customer opens a dispute they are informing us about an issue and a dissatisfaction with their Emma experience or product. We need to acknowledge their frustration and handle the case with empathy and accurate information. Time frame: Emma has 20 days to resolve the dispute with the customer directly before the case is escalated. Handling a dispute: Before anything, it is necessary to check PayPal's Resolution Center and verify the reason for the dispute: ""Item not received"" or ""Item not as described"". -> Disputes of ""Item not received"" Step 1: Investigate the order in the OMS to understand if delivery is delayed due to no stock, an order stuck issue or other logistic order; Step 2: Determine if the dispute is valid or invalid, and act accordingly: Reason why ""item not received"" Situation of the dispute Action to be done Delivery is delayed and item is out of stock Dispute from customer is valid : -> Emma is at fault and customer is entitled to be refunded. Respond to the dispute accepting loss. Order was not delivered at all (any logistic issue) and no longer possible to solve the case Dispute from customer is valid : -> Emma is at fault and customer is entitled to be refunded. Respond to the dispute accepting loss. Delivery is delayed and we have stock Dispute from customer is invalid: -> Emma has proof to respond to the claim and attempt to avoid the refund. Provide estimated delivery date and tracking link. Delivery is delayed and it is in shipping process Dispute from customer is invalid: -> Emma has proof to respond to the claim and attempt to avoid the refund. Provide estimated delivery date and tracking link. Order was to delivered and customer already refunded by Emma Dispute from customer is invalid: -> Emma has proof to respond to the claim and attempt to avoid the refund. Provide proof of previous refund and timeframes. ** Always provide any other proof (if needed) that is compelling evidence that the dispute is invalid. Step 3: If the customer is happy and accepts the outcome, the dispute will be closed. If the customer doesn't accept or is not willing to wait for the delivery, probably the case will be escalated as a Paypal Claim (that we will check later how to handle). -> Disputes of ""Item not as described"" Step 1: Investigate the details of the case by checking the order in the OMS, the items purchased, and if there is a logistic claim already placed in Freshdesk. Step 2: Identify if the case can be handled as a Logistic Claim , and if yes, proceed to offer a replacement. Step 3: After the investigation, proceed as indicated in the table below: Reason why ""item not as described"" Handling the case Situation of the dispute Action to be done Customer received a damaged product OR Customer said the product is not as described Offered a replacement and customer accept it. Dispute from customer is invalid: -> Emma has proof to respond to the claim and attempt to avoid the refund. Provide estimated delivery date and tracking link. Offered a replacement and customer doesn't accept it. Dispute from customer is valid : -> Customer is entitled to be refunded. Respond to the dispute accepting loss. Customer had indeed an issue but was already refunded by Emma - Dispute from customer is invalid: -> Emma has proof to respond to the claim and attempt to avoid the refund. Provide proof of previous refund and timeframes. Step 4: If the customer is happy and accepts the outcome, the dispute will be closed. If the customer doesn't accept or is not willing to wait for the delivery, probably the case will be escalated as a Paypal Claim (that we will check later how to handle). Claims Chargebacks Transaction ID / Payment reference You can find the Paypal payment reference (transaction ID) in the Order Management System (Magento) in the Payment information section. You can use both information available to localize transactions in the Paypal portal ( Payone Transaction ID or Payment reference ). In FluentCommerce: In Magento: Portal Home page After logging in to the Portal, the customer service team is responsible for handling the Resolution central, which concentrates the list of open cases . Open cases Open cases are payment claim s raised by customers to Paypal. After a dispute from the customer, Paypal opens cases for us to ""respond"" to the related claim raised. Our goal is to investigate the case, take a decision about the possible outcome of the claim and reply to the portal in accordance with it.

Resolution Center The resolution center will centralize the open and closed cases. Automatically, the open cases will be displayed. On the top, you will find the search bar, where you can search cases by: Case ID (Paypal identification number) Transaction ID (Reference number available in Magento) Invoice ID Name of the customer Email of the customer Case detail page An open case detail page will have the detailed information of the transaction; plus a section for you to respond to its claim. Detailed information section Possible Outcomes Each open case needs to be evaluated and you can proceed with the following outcomes: 1. Send a message When the dispute is not valid, ensure you Send a message including the reason why is not valid. 2. Add Tracking info If the order is on its way, you should add track info for visibility. 3. Issue Full Refund Confirm the dispute and proceed with the refund for the customer 4.

That is why I always look at sleep systems holistically and offer the customer complete solutions. 3) Customers contact us because they have questions. We also have questions. Open questions, closed questions, alternative questions. We listen to the client - we don't lecture them. 4) I am the expert, so I appear confident but not arogant.

Operations,Sprinklr,Handling Interactions coming from the Self-Identification Chatbot,"TABLE OF CONTENTS What is the Self-Identification Chatbot? What changes for a CS agent / Sleep Expert agent? Go Live Dates How to identify a ticket from ChatBot How to handle Live Chat Inquiries Accessing Chatbot Conversation History Response Time Greetings and Authentication Recategorization Escalation Email Ticket Inquiries Ticket Prioritization Response Protocol Recategorization Ticket Prioritization Seeking Clarifications Phone Call Inquiries Transition to Phone Pre-emptive Information Access Centralizing Customer History Ticket Status Management Refresher on merging Chatbot contacts with Phone contacts Refresher on merging Chatbot tickets with Phone tickets What is the Self-Identification Chatbot? At Emma Sleep, our goal is to provide seamless and efficient customer support. Recognizing the increasing role of automation in enhancing customer service, we've implemented a chatbot, referred to as our Self-Identification Bot , on our website. This intelligent assistant helps categorize customer requests, gathers preliminary information , and in some cases, collects personal details such as name, email address, order number, and phone number. What changes for a CS agent / Sleep Expert agent? The S elf-Identification Bot works as a ""pre-chat"" in which the customer will provide details, so once the preliminary categorization and data collection are done, the inquiry might be directed to live chat, our email support, or a phone call (based on availability and the customer's preferences). Due to that, it's important to have a look at those previous automatic interactions, so you can be aware of what the customer already informed us and prepare yourself for the new interaction. The goal is to assure our customers feel that they are receiving a complementary and individualized suppport, and that we avoid asking again information that the customer already gave to us. This article is designed to guide our agents on how to handle these post-chatbot inquiries, ensuring a smooth transition and continued exceptional service. Go Live Dates Already Live for: IT | ES | PT | BR | SG | PH | BE | BR WhatsApp | US | CA | CL | MX | NZ | IN | SE | DE | NL | UK | AT | PL | FR How to identify a ticket from ChatBot If you need to identify if a ticket is coming from the ChatBot, you just have to verify the chat icon related to the ticket, as per the above below: Additionally, if you have to filter it, you just need to go to the field ""Source"" and select ""Chat"". How to handle Live Chat Inquiries At Emma Sleep, our live chat is a crucial bridge between automated chatbot interactions and real-time human support. The self-identification bot serves as the primary filter, ensuring that when a customer reaches our live chat agents, they are equipped with context and information to provide swift assistance. Here's a guide on how to effectively manage these inquiries: Accessing Chatbot Conversation History Upon receiving a live chat inquiry, agents can view the entire chatbot interaction within Freshchat. This conversation history will appear directly in the chat window. Agents have to review this before engaging, ensuring they are up-to-date with the customer's needs. Response Time Time is of the essence when it comes to live chat. Customers may navigate away from our website quickly, so agents must address inquiries promptly. The expectation is to respond as soon as possible, keeping the customer engaged and providing timely solutions. Greetings and Authentication Always begin by acknowledging the information the customer has already provided. This shows that we value their time and are attentive to their needs. For inquiries related to existing orders, it's crucial to validate the customer's details against our order management system. This step ensures compliance with GDPR regulations and confirms the customer's identity. An example greeting could be: ""Hello [Customer Name], I see you have an inquiry about your order #[Order Number]. For security reasons, could you please provide [Specific Detail] to verify your identity?"" Recategorization It's possible that the chatbot may not always categorize a customer's inquiry accurately. After reviewing the conversation history and acknowledging the customer's initial request, agents should confirm with the customer that they've understood the inquiry correctly. If a re-categorization is needed, agents can adjust the category within Freshchat. Escalation If an issue cannot be resolved during the live chat, it's important to ensure the customer still feels supported. Agents should obtain the customer's email address, assuring them that we'll be in touch shortly with a resolution. If the customer prefers, agents can also arrange a follow-up phone call. Below you can find an example of how the integration of the conversation via the Chatbot looks like in Freshchat: Email Ticket Inquiries Emma Sleep's commitment to exceptional customer support extends to email interactions. The integration of our flowbot has added another layer to our email ticketing system, providing agents with a richer context before even starting the conversation. Here's how our agents can navigate and utilize these enhanced email tickets: Ticket Prioritization Currently, email tickets originating from the chatbot are treated the same as other tickets in our system. However, it's worth noting that the pre-categorization feature of the chatbot may be utilized in the future to gauge the urgency of inquiries, potentially leading to a prioritization system. Response Protocol Given the enriched context provided by the chatbot, agents have an advantage when addressing these tickets. However, the fundamental approach remains unchanged. Agents should treat these tickets similarly to traditional email or contact form inquiries. The only difference is the added information at hand, ensuring a more personalized and efficient response. Recategorization It's essential to remember that while the chatbot is a powerful tool, it's not infallible. There may be instances where the customer's inquiry wasn't categorized correctly by the chatbot. In such cases, after reviewing the details, agents should adjust the categorization within the ticket to ensure accuracy and that the right department or team addresses the issue. Ticket Prioritization Currently, email tickets originating from the chatbot are treated the same as other tickets in our system. However, it's worth noting that the pre-categorization feature of the chatbot may be utilized in the future to gauge the urgency of inquiries, potentially leading to a prioritization system. Seeking Clarifications Transparency and clarity are paramount. If any aspect of the customer's inquiry isn't clear, agents should acknowledge the information already provided and then seek further clarification. This approach ensures that we're addressing the exact concern of the customer and not making assumptions. Introduction to the Self-Identification bot [Video under construction] Phone Call Inquiries The phone remains an integral channel for customer support at Emma Sleep, providing a personal touch and immediate assistance. Leveraging the data collected by our chatbot, we aim to make phone interactions even more streamlined and efficient. Here's a breakdown of the process for handling inquiries that transition from our chatbot to a phone call: Transition to Phone If a customer opts for phone support at the conclusion of their chatbot interaction (and if it's within business hours), they will be prompted to call our hotline. Simultaneously, a ticket is generated in the system, and the customer is provided with this ticket number. During the call, they should relay this number to the agent. The ticket number serves a dual purpose: it allows agents to quickly pull up the customer's information, and it authenticates the customer since it confirms they've just interacted with our chatbot and provided Order Number, Email Address and Full Name. The agent still needs to validate this info with the info in the OMS (Magento/Fluent). Pre-emptive Information Access Instead of agents making proactive calls based on these tickets, the system is designed for customers to reach out. When they do, agents can use the provided ticket number to instantly access the chatbot's interaction history. This means there's no need to request further authentication details from the customer, making the process smoother and more efficient. Centralizing Customer History To maintain a consolidated customer history, agents must follow a strict protocol. When a customer indicates that they've registered their inquiry through the website's chatbot, agents should: Open the corresponding ticket using the provided ticket number. Add the customer's phone number to their contact details in Freshdesk. This ensures that the ticket arising from the phone call is integrated into the customer's timeline, providing future agents with a comprehensive view of all interactions. Open the customer's profile in Freshdesk from the Ticket view. Locate and click on the 'Edit Contact' option. Input the customer's phone number in the designated field. Save the changes to update the customer's profile. Should there be any discrepancy, like an Aircall ticket not appearing in the timeline, agents should: Copy the phone number displayed in Aircall (removing any spaces). Search for this number in Freshdesk. Locate the Aircall ticket and verify why it isn't linked to the appropriate contact. Ticket Status Management Once a chatbot-generated ticket is created, it initially holds the status ""Waiting for Customer"". If the customer doesn't call within a stipulated timeframe and the ticket remains unattended, its status transitions to ""Open"". Agents should then treat it like a regular email ticket. This ensures that even if customers don't follow through with a phone call or opt out of a long wait in the phone queue, their concerns are still addressed in a timely manner.

Returns,Carrier,"[DHL] Drop off label return - CH, BE, NL, DE, AT, UK, FR - Fluent Commerce","Table of Contents How to initiate a return Returns via the Returns portal Manual creation of a return with DHL How the refund is triggered When can this case be resolved FAQ 1. How to initiate a return There are two options for creating a return of an accessory with DHL, a) via the Returns Portal (Fluent Commerce orders only) or b) manually. The preferred method is always to use the Returns Portal as this will automate the process without need of manual actions. Step by step guide (read carefully): Ask the customer to enter his/her data and to also add the order nr. in the reference field (this is important to track the return afterwards) If the customer has more than one parcel, ask him/her to create as many return labels as there are parcels using the link. (or do it for the customer) (If you want to take the time and do the customer a favour, you may do steps 2./3. and 4 for the customer and send the customer the finished return label) Ask the customer to print this label and to paste it on the box Some parcel shops also provide a printing service. The customer can review their parcel shop on this page, to see if it offers a printing service for the return label. Inform the customer that product(s) must be returned inside a square-shaped cardboard box or plastic bag with following maximum dimensions, otherwise it might be rejected at the drop-off point. Ask the customer to keep the return receipt until the refund is issued. The customer needs to send us a proof of return. Once we receive the proof of return, you need to manually update the status of the return to 'Complete'. Once the status is set to 'Complete', this will trigger the refund process.

Returns,Deflection,[2024 version] Return Deflection Guideline,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Return Deflection How to do a Return Deflection -> Verbal Deflection Deflecting attacks DISCLAIMER This article is only valid for the Sleep Experts agents trained in return deflection after August 2024. Introduction In this article, you can check about the 4 types of deflection techniques used at Emma and see a few examples of arguments to help you during the conversation. Return Deflection Let's start with a question: Why do people send their products back? It's normally a combination of wrong expectations and a lack of knowledge. And the first step to resolving this is to connect with the customer, make questions, and show that you care about their issue and that your goal is to find a solution with and for them. The return process can be a difficult situation for the customer and also for the support team. On the one hand, it is in our best interest to prevent the return, and on the other hand, it is in the customer's best interest to return a product that they do not like. So, it is important to find the right balance in dealing with the customer. Acknowledge their frustration and show empathy, making them feel heard and understood, so they can be open-minded to your suggestions. To understand better how you can make an impact to reduce the returns, please check the article ""Return Deflection: Making Impact on Returns"" How to do a Return Deflection -> Verbal Deflection How to do it? Explanations about how the product work, harmonization phase; muscular adaptation; the smell is harmful and disappears quickly. Outcome: Customer stays with the product (no money loss). Example of Harmonization phase argument: ""The body needs about four weeks to get used to a new sleeping surface. Tension does not come and go immediately."" ""It is quite normal that the mattress does not feel ideal in the first few weeks. Your body, especially the muscles, have adapted to a possible misalignment. Now the body needs a few weeks to compensate for this. As soon as this has happened, you will sleep wonderfully on your mattress. That's why you should take full advantage of our 100-night sleep trial.” If the reasoning is too soft, the cores of foam mattresses can also be turned over. This does not affect the durability: ”You said your Emma Original was much too soft? Then open the cover, turn the core with the blue side up and you will get a much firmer lying comfort.” The arguments can be applied to pillows, mattresses, box spring beds, and slatted frames. Please read the article "" Deflection Arguments "" to better understand the explanations you can use with customers. Deflecting attacks How to respond to an “attack”? Below, we have an example of an unhappy and stressed customer, and after 4 tips to better deal with this situation: Imagine the situation in which the customer says: “Your mattresses are the worst I have ever tried! This Emma One is so hard that it deserves its name: you can only spend one night on it! For me, not being able to test it in a store is the biggest problem.” First step –> Praise the customer : ""Thank you for taking the time to contact us and provide your honest feedback."" Second step -> Show interest in the customer problem : ""I admit that it is difficult to find a mattress with the right firmness. Especially with the wide selection of mattresses offered"". Third step –> Address the deficiencies : ""Unfortunately, trying it out in a store wouldn't have made it easier as well, as you would only be able to spend a few minutes with the mattress. And, as I think you will agree, testing it at home is way more comfortable."" Forth step –> Open the door for solutions : ""You talked about your mattress being too firm. We have some options to solve this issue, so you can keep the mattress you bought and have a better night's sleep. If you would allow us, we would love to present you with some solutions.""",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/returns/deflection,Tue Nov 18 14:21:30 UTC 2025

Returns,Deflection,Deflection Arguments,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Mattresses Boxspring bed Pillows Duvets Introduction The return deflection is the supreme discipline among arguments. It is about selling a product that has already been sold to the customer again. The collection of these arguments is the most common in the area of return defense. However, it is not always possible to ward off a return with individual sentences. For a successful return deflection, some questions must be clarified in the conversation - What arguments convinced the customer to buy the purchased product? What need should the product have met? Is there a complementary product to quickly fulfill the need? Ask these questions to get more underrating about customer's concern: What expectations about the product were unmet? How long have you been testing the product? What kind of discomfort is it about? What is the source of the discomfort? What can we do to convince the customer to stay with and trust the product? Use these arguments for verbal deflection: Mattresses Mattress is too warm, causes sweating ""Sweating can have many causes. The mattress only has to process a small part of the moisture released. The rest evaporates. What other materials do you use in your sleeping system?"" ->Ask about duvet, bed sheet, room temperature... ""Our mattresses are already designed for breathability due to their construction. Unfortunately, even this is sometimes not enough. For these cases, we have also developed products with special heat conduction properties. Have you already seen our Emma Diamond Topper?"" ""From what you have described to me, I assume that you are sinking a little too deep into the mattress. This means that they are encased. This means that sweat cannot evaporate properly and the humidity under the duvet is too high. I would send you a hard comfort pad, which will solve this problem quickly."" Textile fibers usually have a slight crimp that traps air. Our mattress protector has a smoother surface and the materials used are also slightly different, giving you a fresher feeling when lying on the cover. You also protect your mattress and prolong its life. is too firm ""Did you have pain before you bought our Emma? Yes? Tension doesn't come in a day and tension doesn't go away in a day. Your body needs 4-6 weeks to get used to a new mattress. Your muscles adapt to the new lying position. This time is called the harmonization phase. That's why we offer 100 nights for testing until you fall in love with Emma."" ""Is your mattress just slightly too hard or just a little bit?"" Sinking into the mattress is determined by the top layers. I can offer you two options. Experience has shown that our Emma Flip/Diamond Topper, which provides additional pressure relief, can solve problems with excessive pressure on the shoulder or in the pelvic region. I can offer you this for xx € instead of xxx €. Alternatively, I can offer you our 2cm high Comfort Layer free of charge. However, our experience clearly shows us that the chance of success is greater with the Topper."" ""Can you open the cover? In some rare cases, it, unfortunately, happens in production that the mattress core is packed the wrong way around in the cover. The (blue) foam must be at the top"" is too soft ""Emma mattresses are made with an elastic surface. This is to take pressure off the shoulder and pelvis and support lordosis. Especially if you had a slightly firmer mattress before, this can be a change. Your body needs 4-6 weeks to get used to a new mattress. Your muscles adapt to the new lying position. This time is called the harmonization phase. That's why we offer 100 nights for testing until you fall in love with Emma."" ""So you feel our mattress is clearly too soft? Our mattresses are progressively constructed, which means they get harder and harder toward the bottom. You can easily open the cover of the mattress and turn the core of the mattress. This should solve your problem in no time."" ""How old is your slatted frame? A slatted frame is usually made of wood. And wood reacts to moisture and heat, which we give off during sleep, especially over a large period of 10 years. After 8-10 years, even high-quality slatted frames are used up, which can lead to the new mattress not being properly supported."" causes pain/discomfort ""Do you have more pain in the morning and as soon as you move a little it disappears?""( yes )""Then it is usually due to the sleeping system. If you have orthopedic problems, you are quite painless in the morning and the more you strain your body, the bigger the problems become."" ""Do you have more pain in the morning and as soon as you move a little it disappears?""( no )""Then it´s an orthopedic problem. Would you tell me more about your back pain? (Ask for symptoms of a herniated disc) ""Is the mattress too hard or too soft?"" the cover does not have a nice touch ""Our Emma One mattress cover is a functional fabric that is comparable to the jersey of your favorite team.

However, the duvet in combination with the bed linen is primarily responsible for keeping you warm!"" is too light/ too low density ""We work for several reasons with lower densities: 1)The higher the density is, the heavier the mattress becomes. This is how we improve the handling of the mattress 2) The higher the density is, the lower is the breathability of the mattress. Density means dense. Our mattresses are made with open-cored foams. Ventilation is one of our key aspects for building good mattresses. 3) The lower the density is, the fewer carbon emissions we produce. Our Environment is also very important to Emma. Double density also means double CO2 emissions. But we are working with high-performance foams. We guarantee you that you have 10 years with your mattress. If not, we replace your mattress core."" is too heavy ""Our mattresses have been produced in lightweight construction. If the mattress is too heavy, don't worry. The progressive construction ensures that tedious turning is a thing of the past."" ""Is covering the mattress too hard for you? ( Yes! ). Then simply use our slatted frame with adjustment. By raising the slatted frame, the distance between the ends of the mattresses is shortened, and covering the bed is made much easier. Even if you have limited mobility."" is not improving my sleep Find out if the mattress could improve the customer's sleep at all. If yes -> arguments above. If no -> Sleep Hygiene!

No improvement in my sleep Find out if the mattress could improve the customer's sleep at all. If yes -> arguments above. If no -> sleep hygiene Pillows A pillow can only work if the mattress fits the customer 100%. If there is already tension in the mattress, the pillow cannot compensate. An exception is, however, if a mattress is too firm. Many people tend to sleep on a pillow that is too high in order to relieve the shoulder. Pillow is too warm, It causes sweating ""Which side of the cushion is the top? The blue side is equipped with a so-called Hypersoft foam, i.e. small gel beads are embedded in the foam, which has a cooling effect."" (Emma Original) ""Which side of the cushion is the top?

(Emma Original, Emma Diamond, Emma Premium Microfiber) is too soft ""A mattress and a pillow always form a symbiosis to provide spine alignment. Do you tend to flatten your pillow as much as possible or do you even use a second pillow at the same time? This is an indication that your pillow is not the problem.""

Tension doesn't come in a day and tension doesn't go away in a day. Your body needs around 3 weeks to get used to a new pillow so your muscles can adapt. Also, an important point to consider is if you changed it for a different kind of pillow (passing from a foam one to a feather or the other way round), that can take time to adjust to new format. This time is called the harmonization phase. That's why we offer up to 30 nights for testing until you fall in love with Emma."" ""What is your preferred sleeping position?"" The cover does not have a nice touch ""Our covers are made of a special microfibre fabric that transports moisture as quickly as possible to ensure a dry sleeping climate. Do you use a pillowcase for our neck support pillows?"" ""Why don't you wash the cover of the pillow two or three times? The work done on the thread makes the fabric softer and more supple."" Cannot adjust the height for me With our neck support pillows or also the Emma Microfibre Premium pillow, individual layers can be removed by opening the zip. is too light In contrast to a natural pillow with feathers, we use lighter microfiber. This gives comparable support without having to sacrifice the lives of animals. For one kilogram of feathers, you need about 40 ducks or geese. is too heavy To provide sufficient support, pillows need to be denser, as a lot of weight hits a small area. If we reduce the density, it is at the expense of the life span of a neck support pillow of approx. 5 years. No improvement in my sleep ""What improvement in your sleep would you have liked to see with the pillow?"" What problems do you have? ->Pillow-mattress symbiosis is too small - regular bedsheets are not fitting ""By folding the cover inwards, even larger covers (e.g. 80x80) fit on smaller pillows.""... Duvets While the comparison with the old mattress makes little sense, the opposite is true for the duvet. Since warmth retention and breathability are mainly regulated by the duvet, the same comparison parameter of the customer should be established. Besides synthetic fibers, duvets made of feathers and down, natural hair, or vegetable fibers are common. Duvet is too warm, causes sweating ""Do they use the duvet 365 days a year? Duvets are not really designed for that. Imagine going to a clothing shop and looking for a jumper for the whole year. In winter, it might be a little too cool. In high summer it is too warm.

Returns,Deflection,Return Deflection: Making Impact on Returns,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Making Impact on Returns Returns Deflection Arguments Let's recap some arguments related to the return reasons Customers may provide to us: TIME ADAPTATION BAD USAGE OF THE MATTRESS BAD MANUFACTURING TOO HARD/TOO FIRM HEAT SENSATION WRONG SIZE COMFORT LAYER SMELL Returns Deflection flowchart Making Impact on Returns Customers can reach us for different reasons requesting to return their recently bought mattress as they have the country Guarantee (a campaign that can offer up to 100-nights of trial period) and the Warranty (right of delivering the product up to 10 years). Always investigate the claim of the customer and identify if there is something to be done to support the product issue and avoid the customer's stress and frustration of returning or replacing the mattress. Our goal is to take all opportunities possible to deflect the return intention by improving our customer experience with their product and making them happy and satisfied with it. ​ First Investigate the reason: What is the problem reported by the customer? Is the claim related to the time adaptation? Is it maybe related to bad usage of the mattress? How is the customer using the mattress? Common reasons upside-down mattress lack of proper slatted frame. Is the claim impacting the usage of the mattress? (e.g. stain or color claim does not impact) Is it clear the product is a manufacturing topic? Returns Deflection Arguments Let's recap some arguments related to the return reasons Customers may provide to us: TIME ADAPTATION Changing mattress is a big difference to your body. It is expected to the customer to feel the difference when start using the new mattress. Explain: other customers have faced this kind of discomfort at the beginning, but it is resolved during the adjustment phase. The body may need a period for the adjustment that can take 3-6 weeks. BAD USAGE OF THE MATTRESS Upside down mattress If the customer is using the mattress on the wrong side you can always recommend him to give time for adaptation using the proper side. Also, using the mattress on the wrong side could also lead to the mattress being too hot because the blue layer (""Airgocell"" foam) also drives away heat and moisture. If the blue layer is not on top, this might reduce this effect. Absence of Emma slatted frame / Emma bed The slatted frame is the foundation to support your body, but at the same time, it also provides the first adjustment. The slatted frame makes up approx. 30-40% of the lying comfort. Even with very high mattresses, you can feel the influence of the slat base. For example, if you place a folded folding rule lengthwise between the mattress and the slatted frame, you can immediately notice a change in the way you lie down. The slatted frame should not be more than 8-10 years old, as the mattress follows the sagging slatted frame and sags faster. BAD MANUFACTURING A bad manufacturing claim should always be validated with pictures. Visual claim guide HERE (To the customer: how to take pictures guide ) Validate claim pictures guidebook HERE ​ After validating the pictures and the claim is VALID : Is there anything we can do for the customer to keep the product and avoid the stress of returning/replacing the product? If the customer is willing to keep the product with the defect with a Compensation Compensation Calculator (Country specific - check your team lead) TOO HARD/TOO FIRM A comfort layer is an extra foam layer designed specifically for Emma to adjust the lying sensation. We have two options available: soft or firm comfort layer . HEAT SENSATION Heat sensation (""customer sweat"" or ""the mattress is too hot"" claims are usually due to the hug sensation the Emma mattress can provide. While hugging the customer, the customer may have the body warmed up as the body may sink to the mattress. To avoid the sinking process, customers can add Comfort Layer. Check if the mattress is not being used on the wrong side. It could also lead to the mattress being too hot because the blue layer (""Airgocell"" foam) also drives away heat and moisture. If the blue layer is not on top, this might reduce this effect. Use comfort layer deflection only if instructed so! COMFORT LAYER The comfort layer is and remains free of charge for Emma customers and you can always offer it if needed for a better customer's product experience, regardless of whether they are still in the trial period or not. ​ Why is so important to convince the customer to try a comfort layer? To leverage the customer's product satisfaction and avoid the return. On average, 40% of customers refuse to try the comfort layer when they find the mattress too hard/too soft. But…60% of the customers who accept to try the comfort layers, 85% keep the mattress. To achieve the maximum effect: Softest Mattress: Firm inlayer on the top. Hardest mattress: Soft inlayer on the top. ​ SMELL Why does the mattress smell? Most new mattresses will have a certain chemical odor when they are first delivered. This is especially true for those that come in a box, rolled-up and vacuum-sealed because the lack of airflow through the package can cause the “new mattress smell” to become concentrated. When mattresses are vacuum-packed, the VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) remain trapped in the mattress. As soon as you open the box and remove the plastic foil, the foam expands and some of the synthetic materials in the mattress break down. These are released as a gas that causes the off-gassing smell (usually also associated with a new car, clothes or shoes) When customers open their mattresses, they will probably notice this odor. This is entirely normal, and the smell should fade within a few days. Solution If still partially packed, suggest the customers finish unpacking their mattresses in a well-ventilated area and tt is needed to airs the mattress. If the customer can leave it like this for a couple of days would be better. Also, washing the mattress cover can help.

Returns,Process,[Online D2C:Global] How to Check trial & Warranty Period,"Introduction This article will guide you on how to check the start or end date of a warranty or trial period. This can be useful in situations such as when a customer wants to return a product simply because they didn’t like it, or when they make a product claim and we need to verify whether it’s still within the warranty period — among other cases. Table of Content ​ Acess the PDP Check Delivery Date Check the Delivery Date ​ ​ key-words Always add at least 4 keywords (two words max to help identify the article). Examples: replacement; supplement; wrong product; new product; product information Access the PDP (Product Display Page) ​ Firstly , go to the product page. Just below the product description, you’ll find the duration of both the warranty and trial periods (see example below). It’s essential to check this every time , as these timelines may vary by product or market and can be updated over time. Always refer to the product page to ensure you understand the correct trial and warranty periods for each case. Check the Delivery Date The trial and warranty periods begin on the date the product is delivered to the customer . Therefore, it's essential to always verify the product's delivery date . If the product is delivered in multiple shipments , the delivery date of the last component should be used as the start date for both the trial and warranty periods. If the order contains multiple products delivered on different days, each product will have its own trial and warranty start date , based on its individual delivery date. In cases where a supplementary part was required for the item to function properly, the delivery date of the supplement should be considered the start date of the trial and warranty period. You can find the tracking number and carrier information for the order in Fluent . Once you have the tracking number, visit the carrier's website to verify the delivery date . Calculate the Trial and Warranty period Based on the information you've gathered — the trial and warranty durations listed on the website and the product's delivery date — you can now determine when each period ends. The trial period is always calculated in calendar days . For example, if the product page (PDP) indicates a 100-night trial and the customer received the product on June 6, 2025, the trial period will end on September 14, 2025 . This would be the final day the customer can return the product simply because it wasn’t the right fit or they didn’t like it. In the same scenario, if the warranty period is listed as 10 years , it would end on June 6, 2035, this would be the last day the customer could report a product claim and still have it covered at no additional cost, provided the claim is valid.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/returns/process,Tue Jun 17 09:44:19 UTC 2025

This article will guide you through the steps of triggering the reverse logistics in the Fluent Commerce system, which at the moment requires three main steps : RETURN WITH REFUND x RETURN WITHOUT REFUND Return with refund means returning the item and triggering a refund of the amount paid by the customer related to the items selected. A Return without refund is a return that does not trigger the refund , for a scenario such as a replacement (supplement order to replace the original item returned). Whenever you want to trigger reverse logistics to order, you will always have to select which one of the two options you would like to proceed with. The steps in the system will be always the same, the difference is only the option you select and the outcome of it ( Should the customer be refunded ?). Create a Return / Pick up of one item, several items, or Bundle Step by Step Under the related order details page: 1. Click on the kebab button Decide if you would like to creat Return with refund or Return without refund. 2. After selecting your return option, a window will pop up. Make sure to REVIEW the customer information available: IMPORTANT - Customer's phone and address MANDATORY STEP: When creating a Return that involves a collection/pick-up it is MANDATORY to have the customer's complete address and phone number (with country code). Most carriers contact the customer only via the phone number, so having it in our system is necessary. If that information is not included in the original order request, please reach out to the customer and ask for confirmation of the email and the phone number. Without it, the return cannot proceed. For drop-odd cases is not needed. 3. Select the related item of the order to be returned For each selected item to return, you will need to provide the following information. 4. Click to Submit. Confirmation will pop up. Overview of the order after the return is submitted. If return with refund is created: a credit memo will automatically be created with the returned item(s) value . if return without refund a credit memo with zero value will be created (no refund). IMPORTANT - ONLY FOR DE, BE and NL ONLY FOR 1MH returns (packed mattress and Unpacked toppers from 140cm wideness) For Returns requests that are 1 Man-Handling, including the Pick-up Date is mandatory . That information must be there so 4PL can send it to the carrier, and without that, the return will not move forward. Agents must ask customers for a date, which must be accommodated a minimum of 3 days ahead of the requested date. However, it's not guaranteed that the pick-up will happen on the day the customer has requested. The carrier will try from the date onwards, between 2-5 days afterward. Example: The CS agent contacts the customer on the 10th of March to ask for a pick-up date, and the minimum timeframe accepted is for the pick-up date to be on the 13th of March. (For any doubts regarding Returns in Central Europe countries, refer to this article: HERE ) Arrange to pick up (up to market / regional procedure) After creating the return in the Order management system, ensure you follow all necessary steps to arrange the pick-up in accordance with your country-related procedures.

Ensure you escalate the refund request via Refund - Jira escalation . How to Cancel a Return You may face a situation in which is needed to cancel a return that was already created. For that, you can use the ""Cancel"" button inside the Return order created and select one of the reasons: - Incorrect Return: Return created by mistake. - Customer canceled return: The client decided to cancel the return and keep the product. - Customer ""No Response"": C ustomer asked for the return, but then stopped replying to us and didn't confirm the return or the return arrangements. - Return Expired: Only to be used by Emma internal. - Customer ""Not Encountered"": The customer was not at home on the return date and also was not available to contact via phone. - Out of carrier T&C: For when the cancellation happens because of a faulty carrier assignment (can be due to the weight, length, belt-size, unsuitable packaging, item condition, etc). For example, if an agent creates a return for a packed mattress, but when the carrier arrives, the item is unpacked. The carrier cannot collect and inform this reason. Then the return will be cancelled and another one will need to be opened to request the right carrier.

Yes [ go to ParcelLab ] Return Information Table of Contents How to initiate a return Returns via the Returns portal Manual creation of a return with DHL How the refund is triggered When can this case be resolved FAQ 1. How to initiate a return There are two options for creating a return of an accessory with DHL, a) via the Returns Portal (Fluent Commerce orders only) or b) manually. The preferred method is always to use the Returns Portal as this will automate the process without need of manual actions. Step by step guide (read carefully): Ask the customer to enter his/her data and to also add the order nr. in the reference field (this is important to track the return afterwards) If the customer has more than one parcel, ask him/her to create as many return labels as there are parcels using the link. (or do it for the customer) (If you want to take the time and do the customer a favour, you may do steps 2./3. and 4 for the customer and send the customer the finished return label) Ask the customer to print this label and to paste it on the box Some parcel shops also provide a printing service. The customer can review their parcel shop on this page, to see if it offers a printing service for the return label. Inform the customer that product(s) must be returned inside a square-shaped cardboard box or plastic bag with following maximum dimensions, otherwise it might be rejected at the drop-off point. Ask the customer to keep the return receipt until the refund is issued. The customer needs to send us a proof of return. Once we receive the proof of return, you need to manually update the status of the return to 'Complete'. Once the status is set to 'Complete', this will trigger the refund process.

Returns containing packed toppers and mattresses Return method: 1 men handling (MH) Carrier: GLS Carrier code : 'GLS_DE' Return Portal available? No PacelLab tracking available? No Return instructions TABLE OF CONTENTS How to initiate a return with GLS First: Initiate Return on Fluent Commerce Second: Automated Assignment to the Carrier Important information for setting customer expectations How to verify if the order was created correctly Status updates in the OMS How the refund is triggered When can this return ticket be considered 'Resolved'? FAQ 1. How to initiate a return with GLS The return process is streamlined through Robotic Process Automation (RPA). 1.a) First: Initiate Return on Fluent Commerce Fluent Commerce Create a return request on the OMS. To review the basics, visit Fluent Commerce return Make sure the address and contact information of the customer are correctly noted in the OMS. Ask the customer for preferred pick-up date . At least 2 working days in advance, and it cannot be during the weekend. !IMPORTANT! for Returns in Fluent: You must set a pick-up date when creating the Return. If this field is left empty, the return will not get sent to GLS and will stay stuck. Note: we cannot promise GLS will perform the pick up on that same date, see communication tips below. 1.b) Second: Automated Assignment to the Carrier Once the return is created, it is automatically assigned to 4PL, which is our Fourth Party Logistics partner. 4PL then assigns the return shipment to GLS, the carrier responsible for handling 1MH products. 2. Important information for setting customer expectations GLS does not communicate with customers about the pick up date. While we ask for a pick up date, GLS is responsible for organizing the day and time of the pick up. After you have created the return request in the OMS, it will automatically be transmitted to 4PL CS. 4PL CS will schedule a time for collection with the customer within 7 to 10 days. 3.

When cancelling a return that is handled by 4PL, you must cancel the return in the OMS AND cancel the return with 4PL directly. Only when both have been completed, you have correctly cancelled the return. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Return cancellation' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Return cancellation of [put your order number]' Once you receive confirmation on the Jira ticket if the return was cancelled, the return will automatically be cancelled in the OMS too. You must not cancel the return in Fluent Commerce, as that will be done by 4PL. 5.b) The customer asks to change the pick up date The first action must always be to ask the customer to contact the return carrier directly. Only if that is not possible, do the following: For Magento Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Pick-up rescheduling' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Change pick up date for [put your order number]' For Fluent Commerce If changing the pick up date is impossible via the return carrier, you must: Tell the customer that the the carrier might already be on the way. You will still attempt to cancel it, but it might be that the carrier will still go to the customer (because the cancellation will not reach them in time). Ask the customer to refuse the pick up when that happens. Ask 4PL to cancel the return (see 'How can I cancel the return') Once the return is cancelled, create a new return but ensure the pick up information is correct. 5.c) The customer asks to change the address for the pick up The first action must always be to ask the customer to contact the return carrier directly. Only if that is not possible, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Return adjustment' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Change pick up address for [put your order number]' If 4PL informs you that the return has already been scheduled and they cannot change the address, 4PL can sometimes cancel the return. If 4PL informs you that they have cancelled the return, you can create a new return with the corrected address. 5.d) The carrier did not pick up all the items Verify in the OMS if a return was created for all items. If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 2. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. If everything was created correctly but the carrier did not show up yet, file a Jira ticket on the 4PL Jira portal. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Incorrect SKU category return' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.e) The carrier did not contact the customer Verify in the OMS if a return was created correctly for all items. If you don't know for sure if it was created correctly, review the 'How to verify if the return was created correctly' paragraph on the instruction page for the specific return situation. Be sure to check if the correct return method was picked for the item and condition . Meaning, if a return with 4PL was created but the item is an accessory, it is not the correct method for the return item and condition. Check the status of the return. The status must be set to 'Return created' after you created the return, and must never manually be set to organized. TIP : You can review the Activity log on the returns page, to see who/what changed the return status. If the return was created correctly, the status updates after 'Return created' will always be done by the system (not by an agent). If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 3. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. You can use the instructions in the article 'Status tracking of Returns with 4PL CS'. If the return was not created correctly, please cancel the return and create a new one. Understand this means that the return will be created anew, and inform the customer of the expected timeline for the return. Don't know the timeline? Review the instruction page for the specific return situation. 5.f) The carrier never showed up on the promised pick up date Review the tracking information via Optilo. If you see that there was an issue with the return and the carrier did not show up indeed, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number: the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.g) The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any Check the tracking information via Optilo, to ensure the packing material has not been delivered yet. It often happens that the packing material has already arrived in the meantime and that the item has been picked up. If this didn't happen, move to step 2. Confirm if the item condition in Fluent Commerce or Magento is set as 'unpacked'. If the status is set to 'packed', no packing material will be sent to the customer as the item is already packed. Check and contact the customer to get the exact item condition. If the item is (unpacked), kindly be informed that the return will be resubmitted. This means that the current return has to be canceled, and a new one will be initiated. Once the return is created correctly, the pickup will be assigned to a carrier within 7-10 normal days from the return creation date. The customer will receive the packaging material in the next days. 5.h) How do I get the proof of return? Only use this option if the customer doesn't have a proof of return themselves. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe that you need a proof of return.

If you don't know for sure if it was created correctly, review the 'How to verify if the return was created correctly' paragraph on the instruction page for the specific return situation. Be sure to check if the correct return method was picked for the item and condition . Meaning, if a return with 4PL was created but the item is an accessory, it is not the correct method for the return item and condition. Check the status of the return. The status must be set to 'Return created' after you created the return, and must never manually be set to organized. TIP : You can review the Activity log on the returns page, to see who/what changed the return status. If the return was created correctly, the status updates after 'Return created' will always be done by the system (not by an agent). If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 3. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. You can use the instructions in the article 'Status tracking of Returns with 4PL CS'. If the return was not created correctly, please cancel the return and create a new one. Understand this means that the return will be created anew, and inform the customer of the expected timeline for the return. Don't know the timeline? Review the instruction page for the specific return situation. 5.f) The carrier never showed up on the promised pick up date Review the tracking information via Optilo. If you see that there was an issue with the return and the carrier did not show up indeed, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number: the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.g) The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any Check the tracking information via Optilo, to ensure the packing material has not been delivered yet. It often happens that the packing material has already arrived in the meantime and that the item has been picked up. If this didn't happen, move to step 2. Confirm if the item condition in Fluent Commerce or Magento is set as 'unpacked'. If the status is set to 'packed', no packing material will be sent to the customer as the item is already packed. Check and contact the customer to get the exact item condition. If the item is (unpacked), kindly be informed that the return will be resubmitted. This means that the current return has to be canceled, and a new one will be initiated. Once the return is created correctly, the pickup will be assigned to a carrier within 7-10 normal days from the return creation date. The customer will receive the packaging material in the next days. 5.h) How do I get the proof of return? Only use this option if the customer doesn't have a proof of return themselves. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe that you need a proof of return.

Make sure that the correct phone number & e-mail address of the customer are available in the order and the pick-up address is correctly added in the return. This is used by the carrier to contact the customer to schedule an appointment. Select all the items, inform the quantities, product conditions (packed/unpacked) and return reason.

How the refund is triggered Once the return is completed via the drop off, the status in the OMs will get updated automatically to 'Complete'.

Meaning, if a return with 4PL was created but the item is an accessory, it is not the correct method for the return item and condition. Check the status of the return. The status must be set to 'Return created' after you created the return, and must never manually be set to organized. TIP : You can review the Activity log on the returns page, to see who/what changed the return status. If the return was created correctly, the status updates after 'Return created' will always be done by the system (not by an agent). If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 3. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. You can use the instructions in the article 'Status tracking of Returns with 4PL CS'. If the return was not created correctly, please cancel the return and create a new one. Understand this means that the return will be created anew, and inform the customer of the expected timeline for the return. Don't know the timeline? Review the instruction page for the specific return situation. 5.f) The carrier never showed up on the promised pick up date Review the tracking information via Optilo. If you see that there was an issue with the return and the carrier did not show up indeed, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number: the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.g) The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any Check the tracking information via Optilo, to ensure the packing material has not been delivered yet. It often happens that the packing material has already arrived in the meantime and that the item has been picked up. If this didn't happen, move to step 2. Confirm if the item condition in Fluent Commerce or Magento is set as 'unpacked'. If the status is set to 'packed', no packing material will be sent to the customer as the item is already packed. Check and contact the customer to get the exact item condition. If the item is (unpacked), kindly be informed that the return will be resubmitted. This means that the current return has to be canceled, and a new one will be initiated. Once the return is created correctly, the pickup will be assigned to a carrier within 7-10 normal days from the return creation date. The customer will receive the packaging material in the next days. 5.h) How do I get the proof of return? Only use this option if the customer doesn't have a proof of return themselves. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe that you need a proof of return.

Search for Jira tickets on this portal that have the same order number as the one you are working on. 5. FAQ 5.a) How can I cancel the return with 4PL? When cancelling a return that is handled by 4PL, you must cancel the return in the OMS AND cancel the return with 4PL directly. Only when both have been completed, you have correctly cancelled the return. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Return cancellation' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Return cancellation of [put your order number]' Once you receive confirmation on the Jira ticket if the return was cancelled, the return will automatically be cancelled in the OMS too. You must not cancel the return in Fluent Commerce, as that will be done by 4PL. 5.b) The customer asks to change the pick up date The first action must always be to ask the customer to contact the return carrier directly. Only if that is not possible, do the following: For Magento Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Pick-up rescheduling' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Change pick up date for [put your order number]' For Fluent Commerce If changing the pick up date is impossible via the return carrier, you must: Tell the customer that the the carrier might already be on the way. You will still attempt to cancel it, but it might be that the carrier will still go to the customer (because the cancellation will not reach them in time). Ask the customer to refuse the pick up when that happens. Ask 4PL to cancel the return (see 'How can I cancel the return') Once the return is cancelled, create a new return but ensure the pick up information is correct. 5.c) The customer asks to change the address for the pick up The first action must always be to ask the customer to contact the return carrier directly. Only if that is not possible, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Return adjustment' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): 'Change pick up address for [put your order number]' If 4PL informs you that the return has already been scheduled and they cannot change the address, 4PL can sometimes cancel the return. If 4PL informs you that they have cancelled the return, you can create a new return with the corrected address. 5.d) The carrier did not pick up all the items Verify in the OMS if a return was created for all items. If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 2. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. If everything was created correctly but the carrier did not show up yet, file a Jira ticket on the 4PL Jira portal. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Incorrect SKU category return' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.e) The carrier did not contact the customer Verify in the OMS if a return was created correctly for all items. If you don't know for sure if it was created correctly, review the 'How to verify if the return was created correctly' paragraph on the instruction page for the specific return situation. Be sure to check if the correct return method was picked for the item and condition . Meaning, if a return with 4PL was created but the item is an accessory, it is not the correct method for the return item and condition. Check the status of the return. The status must be set to 'Return created' after you created the return, and must never manually be set to organized. TIP : You can review the Activity log on the returns page, to see who/what changed the return status. If the return was created correctly, the status updates after 'Return created' will always be done by the system (not by an agent). If there was no return created for all items, create a return for the additional items. If a return was created for the additional items, proceed with step 3. Verify the status of the return with the carrier. You can use the instructions in the article 'Status tracking of Returns with 4PL CS'. If the return was not created correctly, please cancel the return and create a new one. Understand this means that the return will be created anew, and inform the customer of the expected timeline for the return. Don't know the timeline? Review the instruction page for the specific return situation. 5.f) The carrier never showed up on the promised pick up date Review the tracking information via Optilo. If you see that there was an issue with the return and the carrier did not show up indeed, do the following: Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number: the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe the issue with the return. Follow up on the Jira ticket. 5.g) The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any The customer needs packing material, but they didn't receive any Check the tracking information via Optilo, to ensure the packing material has not been delivered yet. It often happens that the packing material has already arrived in the meantime and that the item has been picked up. If this didn't happen, move to step 2. Confirm if the item condition in Fluent Commerce or Magento is set as 'unpacked'. If the status is set to 'packed', no packing material will be sent to the customer as the item is already packed. Check and contact the customer to get the exact item condition. If the item is (unpacked), kindly be informed that the return will be resubmitted. This means that the current return has to be canceled, and a new one will be initiated. Once the return is created correctly, the pickup will be assigned to a carrier within 7-10 normal days from the return creation date. The customer will receive the packaging material in the next days. 5.h) How do I get the proof of return? Only use this option if the customer doesn't have a proof of return themselves. Go to the 4PL Jira portal and raise a 'Request to 4PL'. As the 'Request to 4PL' select 'Other' Ensure all other fields have been filled Emma Order Number : the order number Return ID : the return order number Market : the market Raise a request for the 4PL Central station to action or clarify (Add Emma Order Number in this field): Clearly describe that you need a proof of return. Follow up on the Jira ticket 1. About different return types In general there are three methods for a customer to return a product: Drop-off at a parcel shop (lowest costs for Emma – 40-50% less than 1mh) The customer brings the product to a parcel shop (e.g. post office) and drops it off there. 1-man-handling (1mh) pick-up (medium costs for Emma) A carrier comes to the customer with a smaller truck and one employee to pick-up a parcel or product. 2-man-handling (2mh) pick-up (most costs for Emma) A carrier comes to the customer with a big truck and (most times) two employees to pick-up a heavy and bulky product. For this return method, the carrier usually schedules the appointment directly with the customer, so never promise a pick-up date. 2. About the different return conditions As you may see, the return conditions change depending on the market and on the products. It is important that you ask from the customer what the specific conditions from the product are, so you can correctly select the required return method. 3. About ParcelLab tracking Do you see that your market allows for ParcelLab tracking, and need to know more? Please revisit the ParcelLab instruction page . 4. Bundle Returns (Partial) returns for bundle returns are allowed in all EU countries. For your country specific guidelines, please review with your supervisor. 5. FAQ 1. What must I do if I cannot create a return, the item is non-returnable in Fluent Commerce? If the returnable quantity of the order is 0 but the order shows to be Delivered already, you have run into a bug in Fluent Commerce. Escalate this case to the Return Logistics Escalation Jira Portal . The instructions can be found here. 2. I cannot create the return because the order is not in the state 'COMPLETE' yet, even though the customer says it is delivered If the item is not marked as COMPLETE, a return cannot be created. You will need to escalate this to AR D2C Jira Portal (formerly Order-to-Cash) under 'Order Management' > 'Order stuck concerns' . 3. The customer claims they returned the product, how can I verify this and trigger the refund? Step 1 : Confirm the status of the return in the OMS. Was the return created correctly? Was the return created as a 'Return with refund'? What is the status of the return? Step 2 : Ask the customer if they have a proof of return. If they provide a valid proof, move on to step 4. ​ Step 3 : Reach out to the carrier, to obtain the proof of return. You can find the instructions for contacting the carrier in the folder for the carrier. Don't know where you find it? Use the 'Return carrier matrix'. Please keep in mind that all the communication with the Warehouses and/or carriers should be done in English. ​ Step 4 : Once you have a proof of return, mark the return 'Complete' in the OMS. The refund will be triggered automatically. 4. ​The OMS says the return is 'Complete', but the customer says not everything has been returned Step 1: Confirm the status of the return in the OMS. Was the return created correctly? Was the return created as a 'Return with refund'? What is the status of the return? Step 2: Reach out to the carrier, to obtain the status of the return on their system. You can find the instructions for contacting the carrier in the folder for the carrier. Don't know where you find it? Use the 'Return carrier matrix'. 5. The carrier refused the pick up Step 1: Confirm the status of the return in the OMS. Step 2: Verify if the carrier selection was correct, based on the decision matrix. Don't know where you can check this? Use the table with tabs on the top of this page. Step 3: Confirm the status with the carrier. You can find the instructions for contacting the carrier in the folder for the carrier. Don't know where you find it? Use the table on the top of this page. 6. I created the return incorrectly If you noticed the return has been created incorrectly, cancel the return and resubmit it. Please check if all fields comply with the process for the involved carrier. 7. I cannot create the return because the order status is not 'Complete' If the order status is not set to 'Complete', you cannot create a return. Please escalate this order via the AR D2C (formerly Order-to-Cash) portal under the option "" Order Management - Order Stuck Concerns "" to resolve it.

DO NOT click ""Reply"" on the Freshdesk ticket from the Return Portal or forward it to the customer. Create a new email to contact the customer. Step-by-step process Step 1 : Identify the ticket from the Return Portal. Step 2 : Double-check if a request is already open in FluentCommerce to avoid issues with ParcelLab automations. If a return is associated with a carrier on ParcelLab, do not create a return on FluentCommerce. [ Link to ParcelLab ] Situation 1 : If the ticket is found, assign it to yourself and proceed with creating the return. Inform the customer if the ticket is already assigned. Situation 2 : If the ticket is not found, do not create a return on OMS. Inform the customer that everything is as expected and check ParcelLab for email confirmation. Step 3 : Confirm the return in ParcelLab, then check the ticket for ""Reason for return"" and ""Compensation Method"" in Freshdesk/Sprinklr. Option 1 (Refund) : Customer wants a refund.

Summarized, these are: Identify the ticket from the Return Portal Review the order in OMS and verify if a return for the item has not yet been created Confirm the reason for the return: Trial return or Warranty (claim) return? Try deflection If not deflected: For Trial Period Returns: Confirm if all the items have been selected correctly on the Returns Portal Confirm the customer's address for the collection Submit the return, in the Portal For Warranty Returns: Create the return in Fluent Commerce and process the supplement ​ 1. Identify the ticket from the Return Portal All cases coming from the Return Portal will always appear with ""from: no-reply@emma-sleep.com"". However, it doesn't mean they are related to actual customer cases. An automation assigns them to the right group according to the market from where the order is from. DO NOT edit the Contact fields in the tickets. Please DO NOT click on ""Reply"" on the Sprinklr ticket from the Return Portal and neither forward this to the customer. To contact the customer, you must create a new email. ​ 2. Review the order in OMS and verify if a return for the item has not yet been created Double-check if a request is not already open in FluentCommerce to avoid issues like creating a return and blocking automation from ParcelLab. We have faced cases where customers open the request via the portal and end up also calling the support line. If this happens and the agent also creates a return in FluentCommerce, the requests will collide and probably not work correctly. On ParcelLab, if there is a return, the agent can see if it is associated with a carrier or not. And then should never create a return on FluentCommerce in case there is a label of a carrier: ​ Situation 1: In case the agent finds example 1 above, they must search for the ticket on Sprinklr, assign it to themself and proceed with the return approval. If ticket is already assigned, the agent must inform the customer that everything is as expected and an email will go soon; Situation 2: In case agent finds example 2 above, the agent should not create any return on OMS and inform the customer that everything is going as expected and customer will receive an email soon (check ParcelLab to see email send out and confirm if email was already sent). 3. Confirm the reason for the return: Trial return or Warranty (claim) return? After confirming in ParcelLab, go back to Sprinklr and c heck in the ticket the information provided by customers about "" Reason for return "" , "" Item Condition "" and "" Compensation Method "". At the ""Compensation method"" field, customer can choose between 2 options: Refund: It means that the customer is not satisfied with the item/items purchased and wants to return and be refunded. You can still try to deflect the return, and if not possible, just proceed as a normal return process. Move to step 5. Replace: It indicates an issue, a claim from the customer regarding their item, and that they want to have a new one. Here, the procedure is to follow the Logistics Claim or Product Claim processes, after investigating the customer issue. Move to step 6. 4. Try deflection (if appropriate for your market) The deflection is to be done after the agents receive the ticket from the Return Portal with the frequent from the customer. So, when agents receive a call with a customer wanting to return, they need to indicate customer to use the Return portal and only once the ticket is received in Sprinklr they will attempt to deflect. 5 - Handle the case for a Trial Period Return : Refund Ensure the support ticket created by the return portal is assigned to you. Ensure all fields are correctly filled out on the ticket: Sub category Order number Product Group SKU Deflected (no) Ticket category Close the Sprinklr ticket that was created by the Return Portal. Follow the same procedure as for any return: when a customer asks for a return in the trial period, we try to: Deflect the Return. For this, create a new outbound email (ticket) to the customer. If not possible to deflect, proceed with the return creation in ParcelLab. In ParcelLab (Return Portal) Find the customer request (see image below). Do this by going to: Tracking Search for the Order Number Open the event called 'Return Registered' On the event, in the notification section, you will see an event called 'EMAIL ReturnToSprinklr' with subject 'Order #[order number] Return Request via Portal'. Open that message, and you will find the email that was sent to the case when the return was created in the portal. Then click the link on the orange button called ' Return Portal ' in the email. This will redirect you to an agent-facing version of the Returns Portal. For an example, see 'How does the Return Portal look for agents', below. On the Returns Portal, ensure that all items that the customer chose to return are selected, the reason, condition and quantity are filled, and 'Submit' the return*. From here on, the return process is automated, so you must not create a return manually in Fluent Commerce, as the portal will do so. The customer will automatically be informed that the return is created successfully, and they will be contacted by the return carrier about the next steps, to align the pick up date and time. After all, ensure all related tickets in Sprinklr / Sprinklr have been correctly filled out, and hit ""Resolve"" to close the case. * If, for any reason, you have doubts about the return request, you can contact the customer to confirm the return conditions and items. If there is no reason for doubts, you can can just confirm the return as per normal. After the agent's confirmation, the portal will send the return request to the carrier and an email to the customer informing the name of the carrier. The carrier will then contact the customer in the upcoming days to schedule the collection of the items. In ParcelLab, a 2nd item is created with the assigned carrier and the tracking code (as shown in the image below). ParcelLab will also create the return in Fluent and fill it with the carrier name. 6. For Warranty Returns : Create the return in Fluent Commerce and process the supplement Those cases are related to issues with the product, which can be a logistic or a product claim. After identifying the ""reason"" informed by the customer, please check the Claims articles to follow the correct steps related to each reason (Logistics claims or Product claims) Check if the claim is valid and if all images have already been sent by customers to us. If more information or images are needed, please create a new email to the customer asking for those. If no additional information is needed or if the customer sent everything already , you will proceed with Create the Return via Fluent Commerce, following the normal return submission process. Once the return is created, the customer will be informed by the carrier when the pick-up gets organized. Next, please go to FluentCommerce to create a Supplement. Inform the customer of the created supplement and manage customer expectations related to the new order arrival. After all, please go back to the Sprinklr ticket from the portal, fill in the correct fields in the categorization accordingly, and change the ticket status to ""Resolve"". IMPORTANT: DO NOT click on ""Reply"" on the Sprinklr ticket from the Return Portal and neither forward this to the customer. To contact the customer, you must create a new email. ​ What does the Return Portal look for agents ​ What does the Return Portal look for agents ​ V1 / Version 1 only: The email for this version will not have the ""Returns portal"" & ""Cancel returns"" buttons, meaning, no ParcelLab Portal link.

About the The Return Self-Service Portal Note: In FR, UK, ES, PT, DE, NL, BE, DE, CH, AT from now on ALL requests for returns should go via the portal . ​ Why use the Return Self-Service Portal? The return portal is an efficient and more customer friendly way to create a return for customers. In this portal, the customers will be able to see all the items in their order and select the ones they want to return. There they will also indicate the reason, the quantity and the condition of the articles. ​ For returns only including accessories , all the requests will be fully automated. For mattresses and beds , the CS agents will still have to take action to approve the return after the deflection. If the customer asks you to create the return, please first guide them through the process of using the return portal. You can help them through the process. ​ When doing this, please check if you can see the related Sprinklr ticket created via the return portal, so you can assist with handling the return. As the ticket may take some minutes to arrive, you can also go directly to ParcelLab portal and see all the requests there in real time. What if the customer insists on creating the return via customer support? See the answer in the FAQ section below this article. ​ ATTENTION The Return portal does not cover Magento orders . For those cases, when receiving a Sprinklr ticket that is related to an order from Magento, please handle it manually like the old process, and DO NOT re-direct customers to the portal. How does the Return Portal work? Note: for the actual step-by-step article click here i. For accessories (standalone items) For accessories (standalone items), customers can start the returns by themselves. Every request opened by the customer on the portal, will automatically create a return request and generate a label for the drop-off. ​ In that scenario, no action will be required from the CS agents. The integration between Return Portal, FluentCommerce, and ParcelLab will handle automatically the returns. ​ Recap: products considered as accessories for the return via drop-off: pillows, duvets, disassembled/self-assembly slatted frames, baby/kids mattresses, packed toppers or toppers up to 120cm. IMPORTANT - STANDALONE X NON-STANDALONE ITEMS: A standalone item is how we refer to a product that has only one SKU and also appears in OMS with only one SKU associated. The non-standalone items will be the ones that have only one SKU, however, due to system issues it will appear in FluentCommerce in the same way as a bundle or composite. But you check it, it is indeed only one item. Example: ii. For other products and non-standalone accessories If the return request opened by the customer is for non-standalone accessories or other product categories (like mattresses or beds), the portal creates a Sprinklr ticket that requires that needs follow-up actions from CS/Sleep Experts agents. All the steps needed are explained below in this article. But it's basically: identify the reason for the return; try deflection; create a return, and inform the customer. ​ iii. For Bundles For most countries, the partial return of bundles is not allowed, with a few exceptions that are related to High-Level Escalations/Online Reputation cases. In those situations, agents need to contact supervisors first and they will escalate this to Performance Managers of the related country/market. ​ Additionally the French market also allow's partial returns. ​ ​ ​ 2. How does it look like for customers? ​ At the Return Portal, the customer will have to input the order number and email address. After that, they will be able to see all the items in the order and select the ones they want to return. Below you can see some examples: ​ ​ 3. FAQ ​ 6. A) What if a customer reaches out to us via phone, chat or email? If the request comes via phone or chat For an accessory only >> redirect the customer to the portal in the webshop. If the customer prefers, you can help them by craeating the return for them via the portal on the webshop. For only mattresses or beds >> agent handles it via normal return process For returns including accessories AND mattress or bed >> agent handles it via normal return process If the request comes via email For an accessory only  >> agent handles it through the portal in the webshop For only mattresses or beds  >> agent handles it For returns including accessories AND mattress or bed >> agent handles it via normal return process ​ 6. B) What if the customer insists on doing the return via customer support instead of via the return portal? If the customer still prefers your support to create the return, you can still create the return via the normal manual process, see description here . Before you do this, always check Fluent Commerce if no return has been created already, so we get double created returns. 4 .

Returns,Process,Returns: Wrong items Returned,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Wrong items Returned to Emma What to do if the package is still with the carrier What to do if the package is already at Emma's Warehouse Wrong items Returned to Emma You may face a situation where the customer requests to return an Emma product but instead, they send another item back by mistake. If this happens, the customer may contact our CS line requesting support retrieving the item returned wrongly. Please check below how to proceed: First, you should check in FluentCommerce the return status and if the package: Situation 1: Has been picked up by the carrier but not yet at the warehouse \ returns operated by charities; Situation 2: Already at the warehouse. What to do if the package is still with the carrier (or charity returns) For situation 1, when it is still on route to the Warehouse, the customer needs to contact the carrier\charity directly. The carrier\charity will then check if it can still be retrieved. Only customers are entitled to recover it from the carrier, as they are the ones listed as sender of the parcel and only the sender can do request it. What to do if the package is already at Emma's Warehouse For situation 2, if the package is already returned and stored in the warehouse (and there is nothing the carrier can do) the customer must contact us. The agent must then open a Jira ticket in the CE Portal so that the market's Performance Manager can reach to the W2D team and try to trace the parcel at the warehouse. ​ The Ticket must contain the following information: - Name on the package; - Tracking number used to return the package; - What item was returned instead of the EMMA products; - Invoice of the product returned; ​ Ideally, the customer must provide some proof that the item was wrongly returned to us (for example: if swapped label, a confirmation from the other company that they received an Emma product for example). If not possible, please leave that information on the ticket.

Tools & Portals,Case Categorization,Cases Categorization (Guidelines),"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction FAQ's Effort level per sub-category topic Introduction This article sheds light on some common doubts and questions related to how to categorize customer's contacts ( Cases Categorization (List) ). First, you can check some FAQs and the respective answers, and at the end, you can explore the table showing the tickets categories and the effort level. FAQ's Q. Who is responsible for the accurate categorization of a ticket? The agent that is currently assigned to the ticket. Agents are responsible for categorizing the tickets correctly, even when that means amending an automated categorization done by the IVR, chat bots, etc. Q. For cases marked as ""No response required"" does the case still need to be categorized? Yes, even interactions marked as ""No Response required"" are mandatory to be categorized ​ Q. If a ticket is already categorized, can we change its categorization? Agents should only change the ticket categorization if the initial categorization, pertaining to the initial contact reason/s was incorrect. Otherwise, agents should not change the original ticket categorization, even if the contact has now transitioned to a different topic. ​ Q. How many categories can we have in a ticket? A ticket can only have one category selected. Some categories will have sub-categories, and in those cases, selecting a sub-category will be mandatory, but some categories (like ""injury Claims"", for example) will not have a sub-category. ​ Q. How to categorize an email when there are multiple requests in the same contact? When an email contains more than one request, although it is necessary to reply to both requests, the categorization should always reflect the most important topic (i.e., the one that will take the longest to resolve). For example, in an email where the customer requests an address change for delivery and also inquires ""Where is my order (WIMO)"", the WIMO topic generally takes longer to resolve, so that would be the appropriate category. (please check the table at the end of the article to understand the ""effort"" differences between topics) Q. What to do when there are two or more requests in the same email with equal effort scores? When an email has two or more requests with equal effort scores, you may choose one of the topics and categorize it accordingly, but please leave a note explaining that the email contains multiple requests, indicating the other categories that would also apply. ​ Q. What to do when a ticket initially belongs to one category but eventually transforms into another? A common example is when ""Where is My Order (WIMO)"" inquiries related to delivery delays result in cancellations. In such cases, the correct approach is to maintain the initial category (WIMO), even if the case ends in a cancellation. However, if the follow-up contact results in a new ticket being created (because it happened 72 hours after the initial ticket was closed), a new categorization is possible (in this case, ""Cancellation due to Delay""), since this is now a new ticket and the classification is done according to the current contact reason. ​ Q. If a customer sends an email asking about the delivery date on the last day within the Promised Delivery Date (PDD), should we consider a WIMO ""Delivery Still on Time"" or ""Delivery Delay""? In that case it is advisable to check if there is an Updated Delivery Date available in the OMS. If there’s a new Updated Delivery Date, please categorize the ticket as a Delivery Delay and inform the customer accordingly. If not, then categorize it as a Delivery Still on Time. ​ Q. How to categorize a compensation request after a delay? This request should be categorized as ""Where is My Order"" > ""Others."" Effort level per sub-category topic ​ Below, we assume that for each type of query, the effort score will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most demanding. ​ Category (Level 1) Sub-category (Level 2) Effort level (1-5) Product Information Specific product query 2 Product Comparison 2 Cross-sale Advice 2 Product Characteristics 2 Firmness 2 Material Specifications 2 Product Customization 1 Others (mandatory reason) 3 Services & Store information Payment Options 1 Delivery Information 2 Returns Policy 2 Refund Information 2 Pricing and Promotions 2 Physical Stores and showrooms 1 Others (mandatory reason) 3 Ordering Issues Discount code/ voucher issues 3 Check-out issues 3 Others (mandatory reason) 3 Where is my order?

This will help identify gaps and potential new categories. Comments are mandatory. How to Optimize the Existing Categories for Main Topics Customer Service Channels & Process Gaps Chat: If the customer provides information while interacting with the bot before reaching an agent, the agent must categorize the ticket based on the request. ""Other"" should only be used if no information was provided before the chat turned idle. Phone: If a customer does not provide any information about their inquiry, or there are technical issues (e.g., the customer cannot hear us, we cannot hear them, or they hang up), categorize it as Other – Other . Refund & Compensation Requests Refund Follow-up: If customer is contacting our support to follow-up on their refund request, to chase it or know the status of it, it should be categorized as Refund – Refund Status. Compensation Requests: For any compensation-related inquiries, categorize them as Refunds – Other . Returns & Product-Related Issues Old Mattress Removal Service: If a customer inquiry is about the Old Mattress Removal service , categorize it under Return – Other . Comfort Layer: If a customer requests a Comfort Layer or if it is offered as a return deflection option , categorize it under Return – Other . Missing Items: If the customer is missing a cutter or booklet: Beds: Categorize as Product Claim – Other . Other items: Categorize as Product Claim – Product Type and Component (select Packaging) . If the customer is missing a part of the product or an entire item , categorize it as Logistic Claim – Lost or Stolen – Product SKU . Services Provided If customers inquire about Emma’s services ( Guarantee, Warranty, Assembling, etc. ) and no specific subcategory exists, categorize it as Services and Store Information – Other . Order & Delivery Inquiries Order Confirmation: If a customer has not received an order confirmation email and inquires about the order status, categorize it as Ordering Issues – Other . Cancellation: If Emma sends a mass communication about order cancellations and customers contact us to verify or follow up, categorize it as Cancellation – Other. Delivery Inquiry (Product Name Mismatch): If the name on the box/label differs from what was purchased on the website, categorize it as Product Information – Other . Online Reputation & Escalations If it’s general feedback, use Other – Customer Feedback . Categorize tickets based on the topic raised by the customer. This applies to all Online Reputation channels and whenever a customer asks to speak with a Supervisor (Manager Escalation) . If the complaint is, for instance, about a delayed refund, categorize it as Refund – Refund Issues. Special Handling for Online Reputation Cases When agents need to create a new ticket for Outbound or Follow-up, the original ticket should be closed as Other – Duplicated or Merge . Handling Cases Not Covered by This Guideline If a case does not fit any of the categories listed, agents should identify the main concern and classify it under the most relevant main category – Other .",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/case-categorization,Tue Nov 18 09:50:52 UTC 2025

Introduction In this article, you will check the cases where a Supplement Order can be created and also how to create it in the Fluent Commerce tool. Supplement Order: General Information What is a Supplement Order? Every time an item should be added to an order with no cost (zero value) to the customer, a Supplement Order should be created and added to the original one. This action on the system will be triggered in specific scenarios in which we need to send an additional item to the customer associated with his original request. When to create a Supplement Order? In the scenarios that the customer is entitled to have a Replacement , or when it's a case for an Add-on . ​ For reasons Replacement, we consider: Logistic claim for wrong product sent (from Emma's side); ​ Logistic claim for lost/stolen; Logistic claim for Carrier Misbehaviour (if there's a lack of consistency in the information provided by carriers and the customer isn't the one to blame for the fact that the order was Returned to Sender); Product claim (any). Examples: Customer ordered a 140x200cm mattress but received a 160x200cm; Or if the product if the customer ordered a bed and didn't receive all the parcels for the assembly; Or if the customer gets a product that has a broken foam or a dimension deviation; Or if the customer states that the carrier didn't appear at their house and product was Returned to Sender (please review on the tracking page if the customer was informed about the delivery attempts. if it was, then no supplement should be done, if it wasn't, then we're ok to supplement). ​ For reasons Add-on, we consider: the products are sent to the customer as an added value to the order or original product. ​ Examples: Sending a comfort layer on return deflection cases. ​ Supplement Reasons​ When creating the Supplement, ensure you always select the correct reason: LC - Carrier Incident Use this when the issue is clearly attributable to the carrier. Examples include: The parcel was returned to sender without reaching the customer. There was a failed delivery attempt due to an address error not caused by us. The package was delayed beyond the acceptable timeframe and was never delivered. LC - Damaged Parcel Select this when the parcel arrives with visible damage Examples include: Torn or crushed outer packaging. Water-damaged boxes. Signs of mishandling (e.g., punctures, dents, or excessive tape from rewrapping). Visible damage that indicated that the product may have been compromised in transit. LC - Lost / Stolen / Incomplete Choose this when the parcel is missing, tampered with, or arrived with missing contents. Examples include: The customer reports non-receipt, and tracking confirms delivery to the wrong address or an unresolved issue. There is no update in the tracking for over 10 calendar days, and item is still not delivered. A package arrives partially opened or with missing items. LC - Wrong Item Select this reason when the customer receives the wrong product due to an error by the carrier, or our warehouse. Examples include: The item delivered has a different SKU, size, color, or model than what was ordered. Indication that the carrier may have switched or misdelivered the parcel during transit. ​ Product Claim Select this when the issue is related to product quality or a manufacturing defect. Examples include: Malfunctioning items out of the box. Faulty or defective components. The product does not match the description or images. Missing items with no damage signs in the outterbox Wrong item received with no evedencice that this was caused by the carrier ​ Return Process Use this for standard return-related supplements. Examples include: Plastic bags when required by process Comfort layers when included in the deflection actions Exceptions (Approval Required) Use this reason when a supplement has already been sent, but a second is required due to a special or complex case. In such situations, escalate to a Senior Agent for approval.Senior Agents must add a clear Fluent note documenting the approval or rejection, along with the reason. If the supplement was initially created by a Senior Agent, Supervisor approval is required. Only in exceptional cases,already escalated to Supervisors,should this be escalated internally. Examples include: The first supplement was received incorrectly or incomplete or damaged. Supplement is taking too long to arrive. Additional items are needed to fully resolve the issue. ​ When NOT to create a Supplement Order? We have certain scenarios in which we SHOULD NEVER create a Supplement Order. Those are the following: If you previously created a supplement that arrived in a condition requiring replacement, please return the entire item for a refund If the customer is upset and unwilling to return the full item for a refund, please escalate the case to a Senior Agent to request approval for providing an additional supplement, ensure to use the correct reasons for the supplement reason "" Exceptions (approval required)"" @Senior Agents : Ensure you leave a comment in Fluent documenting your approval or rejection of the additional supplement.

If the customer clearly states that there was damage caused by them (e.g., the mattress was stained by a spill, torn during handling, or damaged by a pet), please make a note of it and remmeber in such cases, the customer will not be eligible for a return during their trial period For those cases above, the correct process is: the original product needs to be returned and the customer refunded; and then the customer can place a new order in the webshop.

If a phased SKU qualifies for a valid claim and the customer chooses an upgrade instead of a return/refund, we’ll supply the nearest equivalent model. Please note that the standard trial-period return right will not apply to this replacement, and it cannot be returned simply because it does not meet personal expectations. This policy is also detailed in our Terms & Conditions. ​ If a full supplement order is to be sent to the customer, ensure the return is only initiated after the supplement has been successfully delivered (request customer to contact back once suplement is received). This prevents the customer from being without the product while awaiting the replacement. IMPORTANT NOTE (UK & EI): Do not send a supplement before confirming pickup. In exceptional cases where this is necessary, please escalate the issue internally before proceeding.

If we replace your product under a warranty claim, the replacement will continue with the same remaining trial and warranty time as the original. "" ​ TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Supplement Order: General Information What is a Supplement Order? Supplement Reasons When to create a Supplement Order? [For FR agents ONLY] Disclaimer! Supplement Order in fluent: Supplement Order: Step by step Supplement Order Number logic Search for Supplement orders Specific Supplement order Supplement orders (database) Canceling Supplement orders Supplement for Magento Orders How to handle Step-by-step to request the Supplement for Magento Orders key-words supplement order; wrong mattress; replacement; wrong order. Introduction In this article, you will check the cases where a Supplement Order can be created and also how to create it in the Fluent Commerce tool. Supplement Order: General Information What is a Supplement Order? Every time an item should be added to an order with no cost (zero value) to the customer, a Supplement Order should be created and added to the original one. This action on the system will be triggered in specific scenarios in which we need to send an additional item to the customer associated with his original request. When to create a Supplement Order? In the scenarios that the customer is entitled to have a Replacement , or when it's a case for an Add-on . ​ For reasons Replacement, we consider: Logistic claim for wrong product sent (from Emma's side); ​ Logistic claim for lost/stolen; Logistic claim for Carrier Misbehaviour (if there's a lack of consistency in the information provided by carriers and the customer isn't the one to blame for the fact that the order was Returned to Sender); Product claim (any). Examples: Customer ordered a 140x200cm mattress but received a 160x200cm; Or if the product if the customer ordered a bed and didn't receive all the parcels for the assembly; Or if the customer gets a product that has a broken foam or a dimension deviation; Or if the customer states that the carrier didn't appear at their house and product was Returned to Sender (please review on the tracking page if the customer was informed about the delivery attempts. if it was, then no supplement should be done, if it wasn't, then we're ok to supplement). ​ For reasons Add-on, we consider: the products are sent to the customer as an added value to the order or original product. ​ Examples: Sending a comfort layer on return deflection cases. ​ Supplement Reasons​ When creating the Supplement, ensure you always select the correct reason: LC - Carrier Incident Use this when the issue is clearly attributable to the carrier. Examples include: The parcel was returned to sender without reaching the customer. There was a failed delivery attempt due to an address error not caused by us. The package was delayed beyond the acceptable timeframe and was never delivered. LC - Damaged Parcel Select this when the parcel arrives with visible damage Examples include: Torn or crushed outer packaging. Water-damaged boxes. Signs of mishandling (e.g., punctures, dents, or excessive tape from rewrapping). Visible damage that indicated that the product may have been compromised in transit. LC - Lost / Stolen / Incomplete Choose this when the parcel is missing, tampered with, or arrived with missing contents. Examples include: The customer reports non-receipt, and tracking confirms delivery to the wrong address or an unresolved issue. There is no update in the tracking for over 10 calendar days, and item is still not delivered. A package arrives partially opened or with missing items. LC - Wrong Item Select this reason when the customer receives the wrong product due to an error by the carrier, or our warehouse. Examples include: The item delivered has a different SKU, size, color, or model than what was ordered. Indication that the carrier may have switched or misdelivered the parcel during transit. ​ Product Claim Select this when the issue is related to product quality or a manufacturing defect. Examples include: Malfunctioning items out of the box. Faulty or defective components. The product does not match the description or images. Missing items with no damage signs in the outterbox Wrong item received with no evedencice that this was caused by the carrier ​ Return Process Use this for standard return-related supplements. Examples include: Plastic bags when required by process Comfort layers when included in the deflection actions Exceptions (Approval Required) Use this reason when a supplement has already been sent, but a second is required due to a special or complex case. In such situations, escalate to a Senior Agent for approval.Senior Agents must add a clear Fluent note documenting the approval or rejection, along with the reason. If the supplement was initially created by a Senior Agent, Supervisor approval is required. Only in exceptional cases,already escalated to Supervisors,should this be escalated internally. Examples include: The first supplement was received incorrectly or incomplete or damaged. Supplement is taking too long to arrive. Additional items are needed to fully resolve the issue. ​ When NOT to create a Supplement Order? We have certain scenarios in which we SHOULD NEVER create a Supplement Order. Those are the following: If you previously created a supplement that arrived in a condition requiring replacement, please return the entire item for a refund If the customer is upset and unwilling to return the full item for a refund, please escalate the case to a Senior Agent to request approval for providing an additional supplement, ensure to use the correct reasons for the supplement reason "" Exceptions (approval required)"" @Senior Agents : Ensure you leave a comment in Fluent documenting your approval or rejection of the additional supplement. If the customer does not like his SKU or wants to return it during the trial period (exchange the color of the product, for example); If the customer ordered the wrong SKU (due to a fault of his own); If the customer does not like an SKU that is part of a bundle; Phase out SKUs If the customer bought a “limited stock” SKU that is no longer available. If the customer clearly states that there was damage caused by them (e.g., the mattress was stained by a spill, torn during handling, or damaged by a pet), please make a note of it and remmeber in such cases, the customer will not be eligible for a return during their trial period For those cases above, the correct process is: the original product needs to be returned and the customer refunded; and then the customer can place a new order in the webshop. If SKU being sent is incorrect, please inform your supervisor and our internal team accordingly . If a phased SKU qualifies for a valid claim and the customer chooses an upgrade instead of a return/refund, we’ll supply the nearest equivalent model. Please note that the standard trial-period return right will not apply to this replacement, and it cannot be returned simply because it does not meet personal expectations. This policy is also detailed in our Terms & Conditions. ​ If a full supplement order is to be sent to the customer, ensure the return is only initiated after the supplement has been successfully delivered (request customer to contact back once suplement is received). This prevents the customer from being without the product while awaiting the replacement. In addition to that, please also NEVER create Supplement Orders to unblock orders (any scenario in the order is not on the normal flow). The correct process is: to escalate via JIRA to: Order Management team: AR D2C Portal (formerly Order-to-Cash) - Raise a request - Jira Service Management for the status covered on the ""Order Stuck Concerns"" choice, or; Back-Office team (if your market has a back-office team). Any other status, inform customer of the expected lead time or offer cancellation and refund. ​ ​ Disclaimer! Supplement Order in fluent: Please be aware, when creating a supplement order in Fluent Commerce and you need to add a composable product (as a bed that has more then one SKU), you need to manually add all related SKUs of the product before placing it. Place the supplement order only once all items were added from the composable product. Do not place supplement orders with separated orders per SKU. ​ Mandatory to be included in the communications with our customers when a supplement is done: "" Disclaimer : Your trial and warranty begin on the delivery date of your first product. If we replace your product under a warranty claim, the replacement will continue with the same remaining trial and warranty time as the original. "" Please be aware, For the record: we are already working to update this as soon as possible and the composable product (more then one box / SKUs goes automatically once selected). ​ Please note: you need to select you country related SKU.

The order will always contain: Order number (generated after the purchase is created in our order management system) Products (SKU) & quantity Customer information (email / personal data) Billing information Shipping information Payment information Order Summary (Total & tax specifications) The order management tool will be connected to other systems, ensuring the information provided by the customer while buying a product on our website, is fully delivered to his home on the expected and agreed time. What is the journey of an order? (Status color will be reflected in Fluent Commerce as per the screenshot below) Order Status Status What does it mean? Pending Order is created but awaiting for successful payment update from the payment service provider (PSP) Booked Order is created and OMS received the successful payment update. Fulfillment is created and has been assigned to a Fulfilment location Processing O ne of the Fulfilments within the order has been transmitted to the assigned Fulfilment Location, hence, the order status moved from BOOKED to PROCESSING Shipped All Fulfilments within the order have been marked as picked up by the delivery carrier Complete All Fulfilments within the order have been delivered and handed over to the end customer Canceled All Fulfilments within the order have has been canceled Returned All Fulfilments within the order have been returned Where to check the order status? Related order detail page: Order list (order database): More of this topic in How to: Navigating Fluent Commerce article Fulfillment Fulfillment Definition Fulfillment is a unique ID to track the journey of a request created in a warehouse, with one or more items, at any point in time. Every time an order is placed in our system, a logic behind will group all items according to their warehouse location, and each of these groups will be assigned a fulfillment ID. What is the journey of Fulfillment? Starting with the order confirmation: the journey of fulfillment (Continue) Fulfillment Status Fulfilment Status What does it mean? Assigned After payment, the order is assigned to our internal system. Waiting for Stock If item is not available in our Inventory - not transmitted to the fulfilment location. Submitted to FL The Fulfilment has been transmitted to the Fulfilment location and waiting for FL's confirmation Received by FL The Fulfilment has been received and confirmed by the FL Picked and Packed by FL The process of fulfillment has been started by the FL Ready for Dispatch The fulfillment process was done and the Fulfilment awaits the pick up from the delivery carrier Dispatched The Fulfilment has been picked up by the delivery carrier and on its way to the customers Arrived at Sorting Centre The Fulfilment has arrived at carrier's sorting center and on its way to the customers Out for Delivery The Fulfilment is loaded to a carrier vehicle and is about to be delivered to the end customer - The tracking label will be available in the OMS once the order reaches this Fulfillment Status. Requested for Delivery Option The customer requested another delivery option to the carrier Complete The Fulfilment has been delivered to the customers Canceled Fulfillment is canceled by an user Where to check the Fulfillment status? Under the related Order page: Under the D etails Tab of the order you can scroll down and find the fulfilments of the order.; or access the Fulfilments tab for more details. More of this topic in How to: Navigating Fluent Commerce article Managing orders Let's quickly review the Journey of the order to review the backend logic that runs in Fluent commerce: The customer will place his order on our online store in accordance with his needs. The information provided while placing the order will be part of the Order details page (delivery and invoice address, payment method, items of the order, etc). From it, orders will be created in the order management system: Fluent Commerce; and the system will communicate directly with the warehouse system (for example - Pulpo) and the related country/region carrier partners; to be finally delivered to our customers. Cancellation Cancellation is possible in our system only before the order is transmitted to the warehouse, which means prior to the Submitted fulfillment status. After submitted to FL you must follow the process available in the related request article: How to: Cancellation Return Return an item is only possible in the order management system after fulfillment status is Sh ipped and the invoice is created . You will find two ways to trigger a return in Fluent Commerce: Create return with Refund an item will always be used when the item should be refunded. Create return without Refund option should be used when item should not be refunded (e.g. in a product claim scenario in which a supplement will be created to replace the product). Supplement Orders A supplement order is an order that can be manually created in Fluent Commerce to add an item to an existing order placed by the customer. Supplement orders are created for Replacement or Add on , and they are always created with zero value. Replacement means we are creating a supplement order to replace an item; e.g. for a product claim or a logistic claim. Add-on is an additional SKU (product) added as a supplement order, such as a comfort layer, or a pillow. Composite Products Definition Composite products are products that consist of several components (e.g. a bed that when packed to be delivered, may contain 3 different boxes (components) with different SKU, that result in one item/product). Products that are sold together (for example: if there is a website promotion, by a bed + pillow with a special price are considered bundle orders, not composite products - as they represent two different products). Fulfillment Definition If any of the components of a composed product are out of stock when being transmitted to the warehouse (when the order is placed), the order won't go through, which means the fulfillment status will be Out of stock; and the order status: pending. After being assigned to the warehouse, each component of the order will have a specific fulfillment and a specific tracking link. E.g. If we look at the example above: 1 bed, 3 components: this means each one of the 3 components will have its own tracking information. Cancellation Cancellation of the item is possible only up to Booked status . When canceling the Composite product item, all components fulfillment will be canceled . Product Return & pick up Return means returning the item and triggering a refund . A pick-up is a return that does not trigger the refund , for a scenario such as a replacement (supplement order to replace the original item returned). The return is possible to be initiated only after all components were shipped.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/oms,Fri Sep 19 10:47:42 UTC 2025

Tools & Portals,OMS,Magento - Tracking Links (Parcel Perform),"TABLE OF CONTENTS What is Parcel Perform? Where can I access the Parcel Perform How can this be useful? What is Parcel Perform? Parcel Perform is a platform that combines delivery information from all carriers in a single platform improving customer experience. It collects parcel statuses from all our carriers and then triggers the correspondent transactional email, like shipment confirmation & out for delivery. The best part is that for the customer it will look like an Emma page. The Tracking Link will map the delivery across its different moments, enabling us to help customers follow their order and monitor the different statuses of delivery, seeing what they are seeing. Where can I access the Tracking Links You can find them in two different places in Magento's Order page : In the Shipping & Handling Information block, which includes both the Tracking Link and the link to the carrier’s website. They both show the same information, but with different formats: the Parcel Perform link looks like an Emma page and the carriers website depends on each carrier. In the Purchase Orders section you can see the current status for all the Barcodes (including date and time) next to each product and click on the link. Both options will lead you to the web page with the Parcel Perform widget, where you can see the tracking information : How can this be useful? Now that you know how to reach the Tracking Link page it's time to understand how can this be useful for you. Once you access the Tracking Link you will be able to find information about the order status allowing you to have a better overview of the shipping evolution besides the status description, you will also find time and location stamps. Therefore you should use this: When you need Proof of Shipment regarding Logistic claims, if this is the case access the Tracking Link web page, take a screenshot and attach it to the logistic claim . For Logistic Claim it only applies to Lost & Stolen products and Damaged Products Understand what the customer is able to view on their side Customer receives the confirmation email and several update emails, where he has the option to track the order: After selecting ""Track your Order"" the customer is directed to the Order status page, where he can check and all the order details and track his order. If the customer selects ""Track your order"" on the new page he will be able to access the tracking links shown above:",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/oms,Thu Nov 13 06:26:21 UTC 2025

Check out the CS Tools: OMS - Fluentcommerce (EmmaCOS) folder for more information related. If your country has already migrated to Fluentcommerce, you may receive customer orders from the past that were placed via Magento. As an order management tool, Magento is a platform that centralizes all order information placed by the customer. It tracks sales, orders, inventory, and fulfillment (barcodes). It enables the people, processes, and partnerships necessary for products to find their way to the customer who bought them. From a CS point of view, it's the tool we use to identify order status, check customers' information, and take required actions such as handling claims, returns, and refunds.

Update Delivery information Custom delivery date - Up to Prepared for Export Whenever the customer would like to change the delivery schedule time , is possible only up to Prepared for Export . Important information The custom delivery date you will change the date the barcode will be transmitted - not the arrival date of the order. This means you should always customize the date counting with the estimated delivery time . Let's see in practice: Example : customer would live the order to be delivered on the 30 of June. Estimated delivery time 3-5 days. Custom date should be the 25th of June. Count of days should be only business days - never include weekends or local holidays. Address/ Telephone details - Up to Prepared for Export Address Telephone Delivery scheduled time (Custom delivery date) Order details modification related to the address is only possible up to Prepared for Export (same as a cancellation) as any change need to be done before the information of the order is transmitted to the warehouse. Custom delivery date / Address/ Telephone details - After to Prepared for Export - up to Order/ Customer Shipped If delivery with Label Modification may be possible directly with the carrier company: upon tracking link availability, the customer can access it directly via the carrier company portal and try to add new address information to it. If it does not work, when delivering failure, the carrier request will be open to us to confirm the address of the customer and we will be able to modify it. Please note: Always leave a note with the new address requested by the customer as in case the Carrier company reaches us, we are able to collect information easily. If delivery with 2 Man Handling (2ML - e.g. beds or heavy packages) Escalate the case (Country related) Your back office or Team lead to request contact directly with the carrier company to try modification directly. How to: Cancellation Order Cancellation Cancel an order in Magento is only possible up to the barcode Prepared for Export. When the order status changes from it to the next status (Order submitted to the warehouse), it means the order has been transmitted to the warehouse and the cancellation in the system is not possible, as it won't stop the processing steps. 1. Check barcode status of the items. If the order is up to the Prepared for Export , the Cancel button will be available under the Order Action bar. After clicking on the Cancel button, a window will pop up to add related cancellation request details: Partial Cancellation (details below) Or If whole order cancellation: select reason Select outcome: No Refund or Refund or cancel payment (based on customer payment method) Sent Send email to customer (always select the option) Partial Cancellation Choose partial cancellation if you want to cancel a single or several items of the order, but not the whole order. If partial cancellation, the following window will pop up: Select the items you want to cancel. Select the cancellation reason in the drop-down Select the customer should receive a confirmation of the cancellation (should always be the case). Select whether the items to be canceled should be refunded. Click on 'Cancel selected items'. Barcode Update for Partial Cancellation For partial cancellation only: After cancellation request has been created, barcodes should be updated to ensure that the cancelled products will not be shipped and/or delivered to customers. Note: When updating the barcode, it is important that the cancellation request has been initiated first to avoid error in creating the cancellation request. 1. Go to Catalog > Barcodes > Manage Barcodes 2. You will be routed to Barcodes screen. Search for the order which the barcode needs to be updated. You can search as many orders as needed. 3. Select the item that needs to be updated, usually the barcode of the parcel/item that needs to be cancelled is Requested Cancel. Choose Change Status on the Actions dropdown. 4. Choose Cancelled and click Submit. 5. Notification will be shown once the update was updated, and you can see the change of barcode status to Canceled. After cancellation If the cancellation has been requested and has been placed in Magento, it will end up in the Cancel Requested queue and the cancellation button will turn gray and can no longer be clicked. When the cancellation request has been confirmed by Order Management (Refunds), the refund is initiated.

This action on the system will be triggered in specific scenarios in which we need to send an additional item to the customer associated with his original request. When to create a Supplement Order? In the scenarios that the customer is entitled to have a Replacement (product is defective and we should replace it), or when it's a case for an Add-on (we are sending a pillow to the customer as a claim compensation due to a delay). 1) For reasons Replacement, we consider: Logistic claim for wrong product sent (from Emma's side); Logistic claim for lost/stolen; Product claim (any). Examples: Customer ordered a 140x200cm mattress but received a 160x200cm; Or if the product if the customer ordered a bed and didn't receive all the parcels for the assembly; Or if the customer gets a product that has a broken foam or a dimension deviation. 2) For reasons Add-on, we consider: The products are sent to the customer as an added value to the order or original product. Examples: Sending a pillow as an extra due to a delay case; Or sending a comfort layer on return deflection cases. When NOT to create a Supplement Order? We have certain scenarios in which we SHOULD NEVER create a Supplement Order. Those are the following: If the customer does not like his SKU or wants to return it during the trial period (exchange color of the product, for example); If the customer ordered the wrong SKU (due to a fault of his own); If the customer does not like an SKU that is part of a bundle; If the customer bought a phased-out SKU; If the customer bought a “limited stock” SKU that is no longer available; -> The correct process is: the original product needs to be returned and the customer refunded; and then the customer will have to place a new order in the webshop. In addition to that, please also NEVER create Supplement Orders to unblock orders (any scenario that the order is not on the normal flow). The correct process is: to escalate via JIRA to the Order Management team or to the Back-Office team (if your market has a back-office team). How to Supplement Order: Replacement At the moment, as we are transitioning all orders to FluentCommerce, we NO LONGER create Supplement orders in Magento. If you need to create a supplement for an order that is still placed in Magento, please check the section ""Supplement for Magento Orders"" in the article ""How to: Supplement Order"" . How to: Discount We may need to provide a monetary discount to an existing order from a customer as an example, when a cupon code does not work properly and the order is confirmed with no discount applied. We can always trigger a refund over the paid amount by the customer via Magento by creating a Discount. Before we proceed, let's recall some core information related to the Refund Escalation Guideline . Access Refund escalation article here. As per the screenshot above, The discount should always be applied to the ROW total of the order, with exception of Forgot the coupon code or Best Match claim. For those two reasons, you should always apply the discount only for the related product and not for the whole order. Creating a Discount: With the order opened, click on the Discount button and wait for the new form to load. Refers to Item: Entire order or Specific SKU (only in case of Forgot the coupon code or Best price Match claim). Select the Discount Reason category based on the Magento Reasons Category guideline. Acess Magento Reason category article here Select Specific Discount Reason Add comments related to the discount Access Note article here Add pictures (if required) Finally, Save the changes. How to: Compensation (monetary compensation) A possible outcome of an order claim could be compensation, which means a percentage of money paid by the guest back to its original payment method (monetary compensation). How to: Product Return There may be different scenarios in which customers may request to return their product after having received it. Reason can be related to the 100-night-trial , as an example, based on customer adaptation or even hardness preferences. Or it can be also linked to a defective product we may need to change. Either way. the way to trigger the return of a product in Magento will always be the same. Access the order-related page, and for triggering the refund you should provide related information about it to ensure the country operations team takes the proper steps to it. With the order opened, click on the Return button and wait for the new form to load. Return Products: Select the related item to be returned in the first collum.

Tools & Portals,Online Reputation,2025 Public Contact Guidelines,"T his article is only applicable for contacts made through public messages on Facebook, Instagram, Trustpilot and Yotpo. ​ Purpose These guidelines support Emma’s international Customer Excellence Agents in communicating consistently with our brand voice while remaining empathetic and human. They complement the existing Sprinklr Guidelines and focus on initiative, tone, and personalization. Mindset & Initiative From script to voice: Templates are a starting point, not a final answer. Use them as guidance but always adapt replies into your own words. Confident adaptation: Adjusting wording and phrasing is encouraged, as long as our brand values remain intact. Empathy over efficiency: An authentic, warm reply is more valuable than copy-paste speed. Guideline: Use templates for inspiration, but always rewrite replies so they sound empathetic, friendly, and human. Encouraging Personalization Name & situation: Address the customer by name and paraphrase their concern. Add context: Include small, relevant touches (e.g., week, month, season-dependend. Balance: Personal, but never casual or unprofessional. Guideline: Show that you truly understood the customer’s situation by paraphrasing it and adding small contextual details. Translation & Localization Principles Never literal , always translate for meaning and tone, not word-for-word. Local expressions: Use phrases that sound natural and authentic in the target culture. Consistency check: Ask yourself: “Does this sound like Emma?” Link to Sprinklr Guidelines Sprinklr Guidelines provide the structure (Greeting, Empathy, Resolution, Closure). These additional guidelines emphasize initiative, warmth, and tone as essential layers on top of that structure. Summary Our customers should always feel that there are real people behind Emma (and our responses everywhere) – people who listen, understand, and provide solutions. Every reply is an opportunity to build trust and reinforce our brand values: optimistic, friendly, competent – and always human. Introduction and disclaimer This article is meant to act as a guideline on what we expect a reply to a public social media contact with Emma to look like. However, it is not meant to be seen as a set of restraints, but rather a platform on which agents can build upon. Our main goal will always be to have our contacts come as close as possible to an actual conversation between two human beings. Hence, why allowing agents to find their voice and be naturally empathic is so important. We want contacts to be fluid and personalized. Emma is a very agile company, so the agents representing us should never be (or sound) rigid. As Emma representatives, we want to show that we are humans, and humans are not perfect. We always acknowledge the complicated bits, so we can honestly and authentically give solutions. ​ Public contacts structure breakdown The four major dividers in a public contact are: Identifying the level of escalation Initial greeting and acknowledgement Resolution Closure Identifying the level of escalation Opening the contact and understanding the issue* Note : the levels of escalation are applicable to 1–2-star reviews. According to the user research, consumers use reviews to assess how well the company handles customer inquiries or concerns to gauge overall user experience and satisfaction. They look for the reviews that articulate the effectiveness of the company's unique selling propositions (USPs), including adherence to return policies, adept problem-solving and the efficiency of cashback processes. When publicly contacting the customer, we establish indicators of our service quality. Not only we try to create a positive experience for the reviewer, but also showcasing our authenticity and reliability for the rest of the consumers. We know that some cases are more concerning than others, and some customers might be more sensitive depending on their issue. Some of them might have tried to solve their issue with us several times and couldn’t, causing a lot of frustration. Some might have even contacted a lawyer to take legal action against us. And others might be frustrated with the product they received. All cases are important and should be treated as such. But depending on the level, we should take different actions and reply in different ways. Here is a quick way to identify the levels of escalation: Level 1 – Mild Frustration / Disappointment Level 2 – High Frustration / Anger Level 3 – Extreme Frustration / Outrage What is this level of escalation? Mild complaints about product or service quality where we can still turn it into a neutral/positive experience with the right reply and action. High levels of frustration, more damaging to our reputation and need to be sent faster to internal handling. Possibly longer complaints with more than one paragraph, use of caps lock, and mentions of other unsuccessful attempts of contact. Highest level of frustration that can possibly lead to serious company damage. Possibly longer complaints with more than one paragraph, use of caps lock, and mentions of other unsuccessful attempts of contact. Specific alarming keywords are used that can give us a hint that the customer will take some action against the company. How to identify the level of escalation? If any of these words are used: ""musty smell"", ""sagging mattress"", ""disappointed"", ""uncomfortable"", ""discomfort"", ""generic excuses"" If any of these words are used: ""nightmare”, ""joke"", ""appalling"", ""terrible"", ""laughable"", “unethical”, “shocking”, “disgusting”, ""shocking service"", ""awful company"", ""absolute shambles,"" ""incompetence” If any of these words are used: ""legal advice"", ""lawyer”, “fraud”, “scam”, “illegal”, “bankrupt” After identifying the customer's level, you can now act accordingly following the next steps. To show contrition and empathy, our tone shifts from more lighthearted to more apologetic as we move up the customer frustration levels. Our responses will also be lengthier at each stage, so that we can give customers the required information. The following templates provide a guide for tone and content, but agents should bring their own personality to their responses, as this will be more sincere and thoughtful. Agents are, however, welcome to mix and match the responses (always checking that the grammar is correct once they combine responses). ​ 2. Initial greeting and acknowledgement Being empathetic and getting the context* Note : always greet the customer; by the first name, unless the customer's username on the platform is a nickname. In those circumstances just use a generic greeting without using any name. Negative Sentiment Level 1 – Mild Frustration / Disappointment Negative Sentiment Level 2 – High Frustration / Anger Negative Sentiment Level 3 – Extreme Frustration / Outrage Direction At level 1, although the customer is annoyed, we can still showcase a bit of personality while acknowledging our shortcomings. This can help to ease the tension and build goodwill. Blue bracket : Summarise what the issue is. Green bracket: Offering a lighthearted observation. This can be about sleep (check our recent comms for more insights), contextual, or general. At level 2, we should apologize and show empathy and understanding by acknowledging the customer’s frustrations. Blue bracket: Summarise what the issue is. Green bracket: Paraphrasing the customer’s main pain points e.g. frustration, time consuming, hassle. At level 3, the important thing is to apologize sincerely and assure the customer that their issue is of the highest priority and is being treated as such. Green bracket: Paraphrasing the customer’s main pain points e.g. frustration, time consuming, hassle. Purple bracket: Assuring the customer that you’re dealing with the issue personally.

Tools & Portals,Online Reputation,Online Reputation - Facebook,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction What is Facebook and why is it important? What does the customer see? How to access the Facebook tickets What kind of tickets can be created How to handle a Facebook ticket (step by step) How to handle Direct Messages How to handle Comments on Posts Mandatory fields to fill in before solving the request: Communication guidelines Our user names on Facebook Introduction This article is meant for the agents working in the Online Reputation team. It summarizes why we use Facebook, how we answer customer queries via this platform, and how to log in Sprinklr. What is Facebook and why is it important? Facebook is a website that allows users, who sign-up for free profiles, to connect with friends, work colleagues or people they don't know, online. With Facebook, users can not only post comments and photos, but they can also look through their local news feeds, create live videos, make an event plan, send messages to friends, ask for recommendations, and buy or sell items. Facebook tends to have a wider audience than most social media sites. Of all the social networks, Facebook is the largest and most recognized social media network worldwide . It exposes our business to the broadest audience and offers the most comprehensive set of business tools. These tools help us build our online brand, create meaningful connections with customers and potential employees. What does the customer see? Customers will have access to Emma's Facebook page, all the posts and comments, according to the selected domain. How to access the Facebook cases Meta/Facebook is already integrated with Sprinklr, caseswill be created automatically following a customer's direct message or comment on one of our Facebook pages. What kind of cases can be created Customers can either send us a Direct message or reply to a post or leave a commemt on Emma page. How to handle a Facebook ticket (step by step) The main goal is to provide good customer experience: you are Emma's voice and it falls on you to understand how you can improve this customer experience by empathizing, relate to him and, in the end, provide a solution. Usually customers who use Social Media platforms such as Facebook are looking for a fast answer, either for pre-sale questions, as for post-sales issues, you will have to assess what the customer needs and provide an answer for it. How to handle Direct Messages DMs may lead to a longer interaction than a post comment. The customer is looking for more than just a one shot conversation, and not just stating something, he is looking for a reply. When you are replying you can see the conversation history and a broader view over the issue. If the customer provided his email and that information was already logged in Freshdesk, you will be able to see all his information, such as previous orders and/ or tickets. In the Reply box, besides being to write a reply and post it, you will also have canned responses, you can attach files, look for suggestions, and if, that is the case, send a link for a survey. Keep in mind that this is a public platform and all information is easily sharable or made public, remember to use tone of voice and comply with GDPR guidelines. How to handle Comments on Posts Unlike DMs, posts are visible to everyone, they automatically portray customers' feelings and how we react to either good and bad feedback. In the same way, our reply will also be public, so it is a good opportunity to turn a bad experience into a better one and to showcase our care in customer service to other people who will visit the page. As in other platforms, positive comments are easier to handle , usually there's no further intervention needed than to appreciate the customers' feedback, thanking for choosing Emma's products and the effort it took him to publicize the good experience. So, what to do here: In your reply be empathetic, address the customer by name, thank the customer for choosing our brand and appreciate his effort If there are additional questions make sure to provide answers or solutions If needed, ask the customer to send us a DM so you can take the topic on a private channel You can use emojis to easily portray emotions Create your own set of canned responses so it will be easier and faster to reply to simple situations and keep using different replies and portray a more customized approach. In contrast, negative comments will most likely always demand further analysis and a follow up . Customers will use FB exposure to force us to provide a faster and a more convenient solution. when you encounter a negative comment always: Keep Emma's tone of voice, address the customer by its name, acknowledge the issue and sympathize with his problem Request the customer to send more details via DM so you can analyze the situation more thorough. Add the customer email to the ticket for Freshdesk to integrate previous tickets and orders information to the customer block. You can still use emojis but more soft as the customer is already unhappy and requesting immediate Canned responses do not work as well here as you will have to adapt to multiple situations Once again, is crucial that you remember of the importance of a good Online Reputation and that you will publicly represent Emma. ​ Our user names on Facebook NL Emma.Sleep.nl BE Emma.Sleep.be OF Emma.Matratze.de AT Emma.Matratze.de CH Emma.Matratze.de MIN Emma.Madras HERSELF Emma.Madrass",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/online-reputation,Fri Nov 14 16:40:51 UTC 2025

Instagram cases Communication guidelines What does the customer see? Our usernames on Instagram Introduction This article is meant for the agents working in the Online Reputation team. It summarizes why we use Instagram, how we answer the customer queries via this platform and how to log it in Freshdesk. What is Instagram and why is it important? Instagram is a hugely popular photo and video-sharing social media platform. Users can share photo or video posts; temporary Stories that live on your profile for 24 hours; Reels, which are 15-second-max short-form videos; IGTV videos, and can even shop directly from e-commerce brands through the app. The app can be downloaded for free and is available on iPhone and Android. Using Instagram for business can drive brand awareness, boost sales, and build and track audience engagement . It can be distinguished from other social media platforms by its focus on visual communication. Instagram is an effective way to advertise a product, as a picture speaks a thousand words . Instagram cases We receive notifications from direct messages, comments made on posts and mentions and reactions on stories. All of them will create a Sprinklr case.

Tools & Portals,Online Reputation,Online Reputation - Trustpilot,"TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction What is Trustpilot and why is it important? What the customer sees How to access the platform How to handle a Trustpilot review Process Step by step What to do after a reply Special customer requests (GDPR) FAQs Introduction This article is meant for the agents working in the Online Reputation team. It summarizes why we use Trustpilot, how we answer the customer queries via this platform and how to log it in Sprinklr. What is Trustpilot and why is it important? Trustpilot (TP) is a digital platform that allows customers to review a business from which they've purchased a product or service. Trustpilot reviews drive growth by helping our company get seen, build trust with potential customers and get better. The TP business tools make it easy to get more reviews, promote your best feedback, engage with customers, and analyze the results to improve. Through this tool, we send surveys to customers inviting them to provide feedback to help us to improve our services, that when responded, are displayed to the country-specific Emma Trustpilot page (profile), providing the rate we are scoring and the reviews provided by the customer. What the customer sees When users search for our shop on Trustpilot, they have an overview of: The name of the profile (in this case, the German platform), the number of reviews, the TrustScore (the TrustScore is not only the average score of all reviews, but also takes other factors into account, such as the number of reviews and how revent the reviews are. Whether a company actively invites customers to leave a review also affects the TrustScore.) and if this is a verified company. A direct link to our online shop. The option to write a review. The business activity. The different reviews, sorted by experience. Reviews, written by customers. This is the customer's journey ​ How can you positively impact Customer's experience and improve Emma's Online Reputation? By tracking positive and negative reviews, we can ensure we are addressing any presented need and having the chance to improve and make an impact to the customer experience with us. ​ There are three sources of reviews: Organic reviews - the customer went proactively to the Trustpilot page and left us a review does not provide any customer information (unless he manually added it) are usually bad reviews from unhappy customers Automatically invitations - the customer received an invitation to leave us a review through Trustpilot directly it will come with the customers' email and order number Basic invitations - the customer received an invitation to leave us a review from a source outside Trustpilot (example: link in the end of NPS survey) there is no order number or customer information associated but the review is verified (it can't be flagged as not being genuine) ​ How to access the platform To handle reviews you need to access Trustpilot's business platform via the link Trustpilot Business ( https://businessapp.b2b.trustpilot.com/dashboard ). This link leads you to your markets landing page : (if you are handling more than 1 market you will see which one you are currently in in the top left) To manage reviews you need to go into the Menu bar >> select Reviews >> select Service Reviews You can then prioritize reviews by rating, as it is always better to address bad reviews first! Customers usually check Trustpilot to find out about bad customer experiences and to understand how the company handled them. So it is crucial that we reply to all bad reviews. Good star rating (as 4 and 5 stars) are also important and should answer all reviews, but as bad experiences are the biggest driver to decide to go forward or not with a purchase you should start with those. ​ When handling reviews you have to consider the 2 main goals: Address the customer issue Improve Trustpilot score How to handle a Trustpilot review So, what should you always consider when you are replying to a review? Always keep the Emma tone of voice - please refresh your memory on Emma's tone of voice via this article . For more guidelines, see this article . Reply according to GDPR procedures - check this article for further information regarding GDPR. ​ How to reply to positive reviews (4-5 stars reviews): Engage with the customer, appreciate the fact that we are also pleased by providing a good experience Check if there is anything something you can help with Try to not always use the same reply, customers value being acknowledged, so don't always use the same sentence. Since ""happy"" reviews don't need any particular intervention they will be faster to reply, create a file with a sample of possible replies and use it to be more efficient and still portray a customized approach. Examples: ""Hello (customer name), thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review, your opinion helps us to improve our services, thank you for trusting Emma!"" ""Thank you (customer name) for your message. We are glad to hear that the quality of your sleep has improved with our products and we wish you sweet dreams!"" ""Hi (customer name), thank you very much for sharing your experience with Emma. We are glad you are enjoying our products, and we hope you continue to do so for many years to come. Thank you for your trust in Emma!"" ""Hello (customer name), thank you very much for your positive feedback, we hope you enjoy your products Emma!"" How to reply to negative reviews (1-3 stars reviews): ​ ​ More GUIDELINES ​ How to reply These reviews are harder to handle as they will require more time and effort on your side It is like a regular CS ticket but with higher visibility on a public platform You should provide a reply as soon as possible even if just to acknowledge we will reach out and solve the problem Replies can be edited so once you have a definitive solution just update it What should always be included: Start by greeting the customer & sympathize with him and acknowledge the problem ""Thank you for bringing the issue to our attention..."" apologize and explain that the issue is not a standard at Emma ""We are sorry to hear that..."" ""What happened is not in accordance with Emma's standards..."" identify the next steps: either collect more customer information for follow up or specific actions that will improve the situation ""I have requested your information here on Trustpilot, could you send it to me so I can track your order?""

Complex cases happen when a customer’s issue remains unresolved despite repeated contact, requiring intervention from other teams beyond the initial support level (exceptional situations: tried to follow standard process multiple times and it's not working, lack of information on Knowledge base to address the case, lack of responsiveness of internal team, possible errors from internal teams). ​ Examples: Logistic claim/product claim/refunds/returns/order delays that we don't have a solution and issue is on hold > 5 days. Tried to supplement an SKU more than one time and the wrong product arrives Quality issues that are persistent on the same product again and again, etc. ​ Escalates to : BPO -> Senior Agent (if Level 2 cannot resolve -> Escalation Squad ). HLE -> Escalation Squad OR only : OR agents perform content moderation. They reply to interactions with customers. e.g.: Customer : ""Hey, I love Emma, haven't sleep this good in years!"" OR Agent's reply : ""Great to hear such feedback, makes us sleep much better too!"" ​ If at any point the customer needs customer support or assistance, escalates to : a Senior Agent, Level 2 CEOs and Heads are contacted by customers. ​ Important: C-level Escalations it will enter automatically in the Escalations Squad Queue (no interaction from support agents). If the Escalations Squad do not have capacity to handle the C-level escalations or in case of Backlog the C-level cases go to HLE agents, the fallback process involves including the team responsible for resolving TP 1-star reviews and HLE to ensure escalations are addressed effectively. ​ ​ 1.4 How to Escalate a case Find here the flow to escalate a case: 1.4.1 Escalate a case 1.4.1a For who escalates a case Acknowledge the customer’s concern ​ Respond with empathy and confirm that you understand their issue. Explain that their case will be reviewed by another team, an internal team, or a supervisor (e.g., Senior Agents, Escalation Squad). Example: “I understand how frustrating this must be for you. I’ll forward your case to our specialized team for further review.” ​ Verify customer information Ensure all details are accurate (e.g., order number, customer name, email address). Document the reason for escalation Add clear and concise case details in the Collaboration Note , explaining why further escalation is required. Ensure an email is linked to the case If the case is not already associated with an email, click Set Email and add the customer’s email address. Assign to the correct team For internal review: Assign to Escalation Squad/Senior Agent . For supervisor review: Assign to [Supervisor Name or Queue] . ​ 1.4.1b For who handles an escalated case ​ Review the case history Check the case notes and the escalation justification before taking action. Investigate the issue Gather all relevant information to understand the customer’s concern fully. Contact the customer Provide a clear, empathetic, and complete response, ensuring their issue is resolved or next steps are clearly communicated. What to do if you disagree with the Escalation Record your feedback Add your reasoning in the Case Notes . Report the case During the Hypercare (first weeks of implementation) we will have an excel file for you to report this cases, please request the file to your team leader ​ Resolve situation - We still want to make sure the situation is resolved for the customer ​ ​ ​ 1.5 Visual Diagram ​ ​ Note: C-level Escalations it will enter automatically in the Escalations Squad Queue (no interaction from support agents). If the Escalations Squad do not have capacity to handle the C-level escalations or in case of Backlog the C-level cases go to HLE agents, the fallback process involves including the team responsible for resolving TP 1-star reviews and HLE to ensure escalations are addressed effectively. ​ ​ 2.

The JIRA integration is a new feature that connects Sprinklr with the JIRA system, allowing Agents to open JIRA tickets directly from Sprinklr, eliminating the need to open the JIRA Portal separately. Check below the principal changes & key rules of using the JIRA integration: Whenever a JIRA ticket is created, it gets linked to the case in Sprinklr; Any agent will be able to see and work on the same JIRA ticket; Any action needed on the JIRA ticket can be done directly via Sprinklr (check comments, attachments, and status); Whenever an Emma team works on the JIRA ticket and send it back to Agents, the tickets goes automatically to the queue and will be assigned to the next available agent. Creating a JIRA ticket in Sprinklr (step by step) In your Case Console, open the case you are handling in the extended mode and then click on ""View Case Details"" on the top right; ​ ​ Scroll down the Case Overview, click on "" Link a Jira Ticket"" , then click the ""Create Jira Ticket"" button; ​ A new window will open in Sprinklr and this is where you must input all the relevant information to open the JIRA ticket.

Sprinklr should display a confirmation pop-up saying: “I've sent the case to CRM”. ​ Go back to the Case view and click on View Case Details . You should now see the linked Jira ticket. ​ Click on the Jira ticket — all the info you entered should appear as a summary, including the status of the JIRA ticket. **Disclaimer: DO NOT click on the button “View in Jira”, as will not work for Agents (only Supervisors will have access to it). If you need to check or add comments to the JIRA ticket, you can do it from the section ""Case Collaboration"". This is explained below on this article. ​ ​ Handling the case with a JIRA ticket created -> How to add comments and attachments: After a Jira ticket is created, Agents can collaborate directly with Emma internal team through Sprinklr using the widget ""Case Collaboration"" . This means you don’t have to open Jira separately to reach out to the Emma Team resposible for the ticket. Any comment or attachment posted by you in the Sprinklr case will sync to JIRA ticket, and vice versa. You can comment, attach files, or request more information for the Emma team handling the Jira ticket via "" Case Collaboration"" , on "" Add a Case Note"" section. In the Sprinklr case, go to Case Collaboration, click Add Note, write your comment and post it. To add attachments, click on the clip icon to the left, select your file and send the message. -> How to open attached files: For the situations when the Emma team needs to send you an attachment, you will also be able to see it via the “Case collaboration” section. However, you must follow the below steps to open correctly the file/image: Go to the Sprinklr case; Find the message that contains the file link in blue color (it usually starts with https://...). ⚠️ If the agent clicks the link directly, it may show a ""blocked"" message — hence copying it manually is required. ​ Click Edit to view the raw link: ​ ​ ​ Now look for the part of the link that starts with: https:// and stops right before the part that says |smart-link]; Example: If you see: [ https://emma-files.com/doc123456 |smart-link] ➡️ Copy only: https://emma-files.com/doc123456 ​ ​ ​ Paste it in your browser and open the file. Then you can download it and sent to customer, if applicable. The files will be named under the Order Number. Example for a Proof of Refund request: 0015-EMMHNS_POR IMPORTANT: If after following the indication below you still cannot open the image, please inform your Supervisor. -> How to check the status of the JIRA ticket: To see the status of the Jira ticket created, go to the Jira case summary. The status should appear in the bottom right corner. See image below: ​ FAQs Q. How can I check previous Jira tickets? Only one Jira ticket can be linked per case at a time. You can create another Jira ticket after the case is resolved . You can also unlink a ticket and link a new one to the same case if needed. Once a Jira ticket is unlinked from the case, you cannot see the summary of it, but you'll still see the notes in the case collaboration section. -> If you need to check something from previous tickets: Go to the Case Collaboration section: all past tickets reference numbers and comments remain visible there. Agents must share the ticket number with Supervisor Supervisor can access the ticket content with the reference number. Q. How will I know if the Emma team replies to my ticket? You do not need to check Jira manually. When the internal team replies, their message will appear in the case collaboration section in Sprinklr. The case will also return to your queue automatically. Q. How does Jira Ticket status work? ​ For Agents, after the JIRA ticket is created correctly and the ACW is applied with Case Status as ""On Hold"" (as per the process), no extra action is needed.  When the internal team works and replies to the JIRA ticker, the Sprinklr case gets updated and goes automatically to the  queue. Close the case only once the issue with the customer is fully resolved. Q. What should I do if the Jira ticket is not submitting? Check that all mandatory fields are filled out correctly. This includes the Application, Reporter, Summary, and any other required fields for your request type. Q. What should I do if the attachment won’t upload? Make sure you are using a supported file type such as PNG, JPG, PDF, XLSX, or DOCX. If the file size is too large, compress it and try again. Q. What if the Jira ticket is not visible in Sprinklr after I create it? Click on ""View Case Details"" again to refresh the view.

Tools & Portals,Sprinklr Case Handling,How to: Case Status,"Introduction In this article, you will find instructions on Case Status and which one to use after handling a customer request. Case Status options According to the customers' request and the follow-up actions, you need to inform the system of the outcome by inserting the correct status related to the case. In Sprinklr we have 5 cases statuses: Awaiting Response On Hold / Internal Hold Pending Resolution Confirmation Closed No Response Required Customer Closed When to use each Case Status: Case Status Definition Notes Examples Awaiting Response To be used after the Agent replied to the customer, and now is awaiting response from customer in order to proceed. For email cases: The customer will receive automatic reminder emails after 48 and after 96 hours. If there is no reply within 168 hours (7 days), the case will be auto-closed and a CSAT survey will be triggered. In a Product Claim scenario, when you have asked customer to send picture; In any query when customer didn't provide enough nformation for you to find the order on the system. On Hold / Internal Hold On Hold: appears on the ACW window & Internal Hold appears when you check the status of the case. But they are the same thing. To be used when the case resolution is pending on a 3rd party reply (ie. Partners - WHs/Carriers, Emma Internal - CE/OM/AR D2C, etc) This status will occur when an Agent manually  changes the status of a case as part of the process of escalating to 3rd parties or internal Emmies. On this status, if the Customer replies anytime during the case being on “Hold”, the case will go back to the queue to be assigned. In a Refusal upon Delivery scenario, when you have to open a refund request via JIRA ticket; or when you need to edit an order and raised a ticket to AR D2C. Pending Resolution Confirmation Use this status if you consider the case as resolved for the customer, but an active confirmation of resolution from the customer is needed. FOR EU MARKETS ONLY: To be used when the Agent has resolved the customer query satisfactorily and the case is resolved. ​ If within 72h on this status the customer doesn't reply, the status will automatically be set as ""Closed"" and a CSAT Survey will be triggered. FOR EU MARKETS ONLY: For LiveChat, moving the case to ""Pending Customer Resolution"" will automacatilly trigger the CSAT Survey to the customer. In a Return scenario, when you have done all actions needed and now have just informed customer about return date and refund timeline. Closed (This Status is no longer Available for EU Markets) To be used when the Agent has resolved the customer query satisfactorily and the case is resolved. Attention: The customer has to actively confirm that the matter is resolved for them. For Email and Chat cases: Moving the case to the ""Closed""-status will automatically trigger a CSAT Survey to the customer. For Voice cases: In the ACW you only have the option to move the case status to """"Closed"""" if you sent the customer to the Survey IVR before disconnecting the call. If you missed this, make sure to update the Customer profile in Sprinklr with the email address and move the status to ""Pending Resolution Confirmation"". --> Bear in mind that if you did not solve the customers' issue and still move the case to ""Closed"", you might get a bad rating in the CSAT survey. So when in doubt, rather use ""Pending Resolution Confirmation"". Agent has resolved the customer’s concern, confirming that the issue has been addressed and no further steps are required. No Response Required To be used when no reply is sent to the customer. It can only be triggerd by Macro (please check the Macro article). -- For Spam/Unactionable cases and no answer to customer is needed. Customer Closed User actively closed the chat conversation on the website This status is automatically applied to a chat case when the User actively closes the the chat conversation on the website. ​",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/sprinklr-case-handling,Tue Nov 18 03:54:00 UTC 2025

Tools & Portals,Sprinklr Case Handling,How to: handle Anonymous cases,"IMPORTANT: DO NOT edit an Anonymous profile, don't insert any customer information or order information. You must follow the steps indicated in this article. What are Anonymous cases? An Anonymous case is when the customer reaches out as an unidentified contact . This means that their name, phone number, email will not appear on our system once the case is created. And what is the impact of those cases? ​ Technically, all the Anonymous cases get register in the same Anonymous profile, no matter the market or the language.  This means the same profile can have information from different customers and orders numbers, and those conflict information will make difficult for everyone to really understand the request. ​ That's why is PROHIBITED TO EDIT anything on an anonymous profile when receiving an anonymous incoming contact. Agents must instead follow the steps indicated in this article. ​ How to identify an Anonymous case in Sprinklr? On the moment you the case opens for you on the system, you need to identify if the Incoming contact (Voice or Live-chat) shows an indication as Anonymous. Check the example below: Phone calls: Live chats: How to handle Anonymous cases? After indentify and confirm that the contact is Anonymous, please follow the steps: Step 1: Inform the customer that the incoming case is showing as Anonymus is our system and confirm if the customer allows you to save the information on the system and identify himself/herself. Please explain that this will create a profile on the system that register all the interactions they have with us and facilitates when looking for previous cases. If customer says NO : you cannot save their information on the profile. Step 2: If customer allows, it is MANDATORY that you create a new case/outbound email in order to be able to register the customer information in a new case, and not in the one that was open during the incoming contact. Note: Check here the article ""How to create new case/email outbound"" . Step 3: You have to send the outbound email when still in the call/live-chat with the customer. Because the outbound email will create a new case, and automatically a new profile, in which you can add the customer information correctly. After that, on the ""case collaboration"" column, you need to leave a note explaining the case was originally from an Anonymous incoming contact and put the original case number just for reference. But everything else from that customer, will be handled form the new profile created.",https://sites.google.com/outscaler.com/outscalerknowledgebas/agent-operations/tools-portals/sprinklr-case-handling,Mon Nov 17 08:54:02 UTC 2025
